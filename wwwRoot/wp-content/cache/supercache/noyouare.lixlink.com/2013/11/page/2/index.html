			<p>Evening, bitches. Some day you are going to die, and there is not a god damn thing you can do about it. One silver lining is that you can choose what exactly you leave behind so that people will look at something one day and say &#8220;Oh yeah, that guy.&#8221; When Ellis dies he is afraid they are going replace him with Rick Thorn on Faction. That is a good question though: just how long will Faction play replays if Jason dies of a heroin overdose? One, two weeks?</p>
<p>Jason started rattling off about how True Religion jeans and how the people who wear them are uncool kooks who have no sense of fashion. I must be cool as hell because I&#8217;ve never heard of True Religion jeans outside of the show. Either that or where I live is truly the backwoods of fuck all nowhere and that fad just hasn&#8217;t reached us yet. But hey, fuck you at least it&#8217;s not Canada. Oh! Ellis has turned over a new leaf on Instagram, deciding that anyone being hateful or negative gets an automatic block. And it seems to be working because all the comments I saw on his IG today were people crawling over eachother to climb into his ass like Sam Ruben. Oh yeah, Sam Ruben called in because he must have been running low on Jason Ellis ass cologne and needed to take a quick dip to rejuvenate his annoying ass. I do enjoy how the guys are calling him on his bullshit more often now, and he&#8217;s becoming a punching bag on the show even if he is an annoying windbag.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/20/freddie-roach-manny-pacquiao-brandon-rios_n_4308727.html">Freddie Roach got kicked in the motherfucking chest</a>. So while in China, preparing the next who gives a shit boxing match, Freddie shows up to the gym and there was some dispute about what time they were allowed to train and the other guys were still there. Words were exchanged, Freddie in some shape or form called the guy a Mexican, and the dude kicked him in the chest. For any normal dude, this may seem like a reasonable reaction. Freddie Roach, however has Parkinson&#8217;s disease and it doesn&#8217;t matter if he makes pussy licking gestures to your mom, you don&#8217;t kick the dude in the chest. This spurned a topic on race and racial slurs. Josh, ever the pussy in his white guilt, thinks nobody should ever call other people names based on their race. Even jokingly! Unless you aren&#8217;t white. Then it&#8217;s ok of course. Which brings me of course to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx1J2CzNnS8">Gangster Hotline</a>, which you can call and start some shit, N bomb.</p>
<p>After the break the guys all took a psycho test. Gauging just crazy Jason is, based on a test a psychologist came up with. They never got to the results, but I think I heard something about having to get results back at a later date. You know who is fucking crazy? David Blaine. Ok, maybe he isn&#8217;t as crazy as he is annoying and phony. But he blew Ricky Gervais&#8217; mind with a trick where he stuck a needle through his arm and Ricky was all &#8220;Daaavid, &#8216;ave yoo gone MENtal guvnah?&#8221; David Blaine sounds like he has had his jaw wired shut according to Tully, and really anyone who listens to him. Tully knows magic, his spidey sense started tingling and he felt an enormous psychic force telling him Dominick Cruz was about to call.</p>
<p>Dominick Cruz called in! For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Dominick is the bantamweight champion in the UFC. For the past 2 years though, he has been out with a knee injury, of which he is now recovered. He will be defending his belt finally against Renan Barao at UFC 169. They talked for a while about his knee, and his stint doing commentary for the UFC while he was on the DL. Dominick and Ellis have a longstanding bet to be carried out where Ellis needs to punch him in the face. The standards were set, after Dominick&#8217;s fight, he is going to give Ellis 2 minutes to punch him in the face. If Ellis punches him, Domonick has to&#8230;.well I don&#8217;t remember, but if Dominick avoids him, Jason will let a Monster Energy girl tattoo Domonick&#8217;s name on his ass. The guys joked that Ellis&#8217; ass is going to end up being like a bathroom wall in a legendary rock venue or something. It was fun, we all laughed, you should have been there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fought it guys. I&#8217;ve held vigilant against the cruel fate dealt to me time and time again. I waged what I felt was a civil battle, standing up for what I thought was right. What I believed was right. But there is a point where the whole world seems to be jamming it&#8217;s metaphorical dick in your literal ass. New Music Tuesday was once again pushed to Wednesday, and I can&#8217;t help but think that at this point, they are just fucking with my brain. So with a heavy heart, I bring to you a recap of New Music Tuesday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some blinky bloopy shit that Rawdog swears is really good.</li>
<li>Justin Bieber dropped a single called &#8220;PYD&#8221; or, &#8220;Put you down.&#8221; If you listened closely, you could hear the sound of hymens popping across Midwestern middle schools.</li>
<li>Colbie Caillet dropped her cutesy bullshit once more like the button she is.</li>
<li>Lorde, the 16-year-old Kiwi with a voice of silken gold cashed a ginormous check to support her future heroin addiction for her work on the Hunger Games soundtrack.</li>
<li>Five Finger Death Punch is still finding success with the Nickelback Cookie Monster routine that gets the dudebros as wet as a cat in the rain.</li>
<li>Dave Grohl saved the good shit for Foo Fighters with some new bullshit.</li>
<li>Some rapper wrote a song called Versace where he repeated Versace over and over again because he is neither talented or imaginative.</li>
<li>Some band called Death! Death! Die! released a song called Will! (The Government) Which I think was an instrumental track, because either there were no vocals, or they were so low in the mix I couldn&#8217;t hear them at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kanye West released a music <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAtAM7vtgc">video</a> of his new song where Kim Kardashian is riding on him naked, reverse motosaki style. She kind of just lays there while either him or the studio effects bounce her around, much like the actual footage of her having sex on camera. She is kind of the queen of doing nothing, and at this point Kanye is pretty much her last crutch on staying relevant five years from now. That and the inevitable child support battles that will be sure to tear the normal childhood away from little North West&#8217;s tiny hands. But hey, she&#8217;s got huge tits and a ton of money to spend on personal trainers and I&#8217;d totally let her rag doll it for a night so there ya go.</p>
<p>Lastly, Tully read a <a href="http://filterlessness.blogspot.com/2013/11/open-letter-to-jason-ellis-show.html?m=1">blog post</a> from our very own, <a href="https://twitter.com/jennimazky">@JenniMazky</a> about how great Ellisfam is. As always, Jenni&#8217;s writing is flawless and captured the thoughts and feelings that the rest of the mongrels in Ellisfam can only dream of putting into words. We really are just monkeys throwing bricks at a foam alphabet puzzle compared to her, so I encourage you to go read her work, because she has a passion for what she does. We love you Jenny, thanks for making us look like we have our shit together.</p>

			<p>So, if you follow me on twitter you certainly would know by now how much I despise telemarketers and hope that every single one of them commits suicide in the most gruesome, family destroying, religion defying, blood shit and semen covered way possible, but lately my shop has been kind of slow and to counter that, I have become the one thing I despise most and was cold calling customers for a good part of the day. To reclaim my self worth, I&#8217;m gonna need something really good out of the Ellis show this afternoon. Let&#8217;s see what he&#8217;s got in store, yes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s show kicked off with talk of how the internet is a lying, cheating, fucking cunt, unless it&#8217;s saying something nice about you or doing something that goes to a good cause. Ellis is a little tired of all the folks who say he never responds on twitter so he&#8217;s trying to show a little more appreciation for the fans and DM people back as long as they&#8217;re not being shit heads. Tiger is making excellent progress towards being a child motocross prodigy. At just four years old with no modifications, he can reach all the working parts on a full size dirt bike, and he&#8217;s borne of a long line of sick cunts, so chances are when he&#8217;s old enough to say cunt without getting sent to bed with no dinner, he&#8217;ll probably be a sick cunt too. Provided he doesn&#8217;t injure himself too badly before he has a chance to shine. Jason is thinking of stepping the game up from tattoos to scarification, and of course, what better place to get your first one than right on your face? This whole thing started because Ellis still has that weird lump on the side of his face and is thinking about getting it cut off, but want&#8217;s something badass to scorch the earth from which it is expunged. Jason deposited a paycheck that mystically appeared this morning and is thinking of buying a washer and dryer and a new bike to replace the ones that are sitting in his garage costing money to do nothing. Oh, and maybe Christmas presents for the kids too, but we&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Jude stopped by to chat with the guys a bit about all the shit he missed at EllisMania and how Popeye&#8217;s chicken needs to fuck off with the turkeys they&#8217;re gonna be selling for thanksgiving. Jude Stopped by a Popeye&#8217;s under the freeway over in the ghetto to help his friends pick up their holiday birds. Tully doesn&#8217;t get why everybody thinks that turkeys only come out of hibernation two months out of the year to be slaughtered en masse for human enjoyment. He&#8217;ll roast that shit any time of year and make a sandwich so good you&#8217;ll feel like it just gave you a blow job. Rawdog had to chime in because this year, Hanukkah starts the day before thanksgiving, so it&#8217;s gonna be feasting and mitzvahs and wine that tastes like it&#8217;s 40% high fructose corn syrup, but in Josh&#8217;s world it&#8217;s more like speech impediments for eight solid days and Snaggle tooth tries to burn the house down when she sees a mouse and then everyone goes out for nuggets. Some guy called in to see if he could give Ellis a free dirt bike and the guys ended up talking about honey bees for a few minutes. Someone else floated the idea of Ellis doing a motocross movie, something much like the Woodsman or Big Fucking Mega Boat. But with moto. Rawdog is already plotting how to direct this movie into the ground like &#8220;Psycho&#8221; but without a major studio shitting all over it. The guys started kicking around ideas on what the plot would be and how much they can make it suck into awesomeness and which celebrity cameos they could beg for from all Ellis&#8217; moto friends. Basically, it would be an 18 year old Jason Ellis who came from nowhere to be a dirtbike champion, and at some point in the movie, Jason would shave off his gorgeous youthful locks and already have a full head tattoo underneath. Some folks called in to give the guys ideas about how to go about making this movie, and who should star in it, like maybe Rawdog as the young Ellis, so no real acting would be required to look like crap on a motorcycle. Pendarvis came in to see if the guys would be willing to donate the budget from the movie to the SiriusXM faction bank account, because apparently the subscription fees aren&#8217;t covering NOT having working internet and handymen who fuck shit up in the studio at night. Jude volunteered to be the obnoxious British guy on a Vespa in the moto movie and gave us a great taste of his Detroit Queen&#8217;s English accent. More movie ideas started flowing, like having Katie show her tits (cause that just wouldn&#8217;t be family friendly and because the fans are fucking assholes), and making it safe for TV edited without actually having to make it edited and overdubbed, or having Rob Zombie make a cameo to complain about the noise! There was a whole bunch more of this and it all sounds like it&#8217;s gonna culminate in yet another directors cut with a four minute loop of a vagina fart (but a family friendly one, it&#8217;s not a vagina fart kind of movie). Jude&#8217;s car broke down and he had to ride the bus to the studio today and that shit took TWO HOURS CAUSE THE BUS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT! And the entire public transit system stinks like bologna and urine, especially the one in L.A. (I&#8217;m looking accusingly at you, AC Transit and BART, clean the fucking equipment for fuck&#8217;s sake). But on the plus side, he&#8217;s got a podcast called foreally show and you can download that shit for hella free. Some more calls about the movie came in and there were some half decent ones like how motocross goes on strike and they have to call in scabs to revive the sport, and making Tiger into the steroid-induced Benjamin Button of freestyle moto, and making sure novice rider Josh Richmond gets a DNF at every event, but keeps coming back for the thrill time and time again. The guys decided to crank a few minutes of Akka Dakka to let all these plans stew into a wonderful chili of moto movie awesomeness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tully has noticed that Linsanity has been crying more than normal lately, so he decided to Google it and god damn if the internet isn&#8217;t the most horrible thing ever because when you Google 2 year old tantrums, you might get directed to a site devoted to infant masturbation. NOT LIKE PEDO SHIT BUT AN ACTUAL MEDICAL WEBSITE DEVOTED TO WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR KIDS START BUFFING THE PIG. And sure enough, the Christians are all over this site trying to figure out how to make sure their kids are ashamed of enjoying anything about their bodies unless they&#8217;re married to a person who knows just as little about how fun it is to blast a load off or pound out a drunk chick&#8217;s vag in the back of a minivan that she stole from her dad. This all brought on a conversation about how Christianity isn&#8217;t inherently bad, but you can fuck up your kids with it pretty easily. The guys from RCH called during the break and let Ellis know that his new bike is on the way, but in the meantime they&#8217;ve got a loaner for him to thrash so he doesn&#8217;t need to spend any money on anything to blow the tires off of. If you get a chance, you should check out Ellis&#8217; twitter, cause there&#8217;s a link there to go vote on the Reverse Awards, and there&#8217;s not anything officially stopping you from voting over and over again, so if you&#8217;ve got the time to try and guarantee a win for a category you really want, then grab yourself a case of Mountain Dew and get clicking! The guys took some phone calls about Christians and masturbation and long story short, it&#8217;s one of those rules that&#8217;s more superstition and not actually a hard fast law anywhere in the bible, but good luck getting people to stop saying so. Tully seems convinced that in olden times, there just couldn&#8217;t have been a more well practiced hobby than slapping your junk around in the days before TV and indoor lighting. Hell, it&#8217;s a pretty big enterprise even nowadays. Rawdog watched some movie about a fucked up Christian camp and it seems like I might have seen it too but neither of us can remember enough specifics to make a concrete statement about it. Rihanna called in (but probably not the one we thought by the name) and she was always taught that it is better to spill your seed in the belly of a whore than to throw it on the ground, which makes no sense cause if you spray a gob of unborn children in the dirt it won&#8217;t turn into anything you&#8217;ve gotta feed and clean up after, and if you try to stuff a tomato plant in a prostitute she&#8217;s gonna charge extra. It all goes back to the fact that if you really study religion in history, most of these rules were from a very different time in human history when even smart people were dumb enough to set themselves on fire routinely and try to have harems of livestock, and they needed fucking guidelines to keep them from drowning in their own vomit from eating shitty meat or letting their tribe die out cause no one was fucking, or turning your relatives into hooved beasts cause a thousand people all fucked each other with no rules and made a couple generations of inbred Norwegians. Some guy called in to apologize to Rawdog for trolling him on Instagram, apparently he was up really late and was getting fed by all the other people who talk shit on everybody else on the internet. Ellis got a chance to apologize to Donald Schultz over some relatively unimportant beef, and they&#8217;re gonna be friends no matter what and there may be snakes involved in his next appearance. Pendarvis came in to declare mitzvahs all around for everyone being grown up enough to apologize. Jason had to deal with insurance adjusters and the people at Porsche today and as a member of the auto industry, I know exactly what an absolute load of wombat shite it can be to try and get an insurance company to make good on the product they sell, and how unnecessarily difficult German cars can be to fix. Pendarvis basically told him to just text everyone involved a picture of his war face to put a fire under everyone&#8217;s ass so he can just get the god damn car back and enjoy driving it again. Some dude tried to be a dick in Ellis&#8217; driveway again and the kids almost got to see their dad beat up a pudgy little shithead taxi driver, but they were asleep after a long day riding horses. Lucky for him though, taxi drivers know when to put the hammer down and he got the broke the fuck out before trying to challenge an overly emotional Australian who&#8217;s also a trained fighter. Jason has been thinking more and more about how things in his life are stressful, but there&#8217;s also so many goals of his that are coming closer in view, and despite how great some of the more grandiose fantasies would be, just living well would be a way better outcome. But there&#8217;s always the &#8220;could be better&#8221; mentality that pretty much everyone gets at some point or another. It seems that he&#8217;s starting to understand the difference between wants and needs and it&#8217;s totally possible to get a little bit of both and a whole lot else along the way and still be perfectly happy. Will can relate cause he grew up pretty poor and even at the outlet mall people looked at him and his family like they were scum class citizens. Rawdog grew up sort of well taken care of and always thought his rich kid friends who had $50,000 bar mitzvahs and flashy cars in high school were dumbasses for throwing it around when they didn&#8217;t even really earn it and never learning to be responsible about it. Will admitted that half the reason he stayed to endure the torture that it is to work with the guys is because he wants to see this baby bird called the Jason Ellis show grow to be so big and strong that it can pick up a wildebeest in each clawed foot and drop the deboned carcasses at the top of the Swiss alps with a fresh pair of boots made out of the aforementioned wildebeest&#8217;s hides. And to say thank you for such a wonderful sentiment, the guys played a new Death!Death!Die! song for him! And if you liked Butt Town, you have no idea how much better of a song Will got. Seriously, it was like every Elton John tribute song got covered by Pennywise all in one track. If you want that track on your iPod, you can go to deathdeathdie.com and pre-order the CD now. They&#8217;re shipping out next week folks, don&#8217;t miss the fucking extravaganza. The guys did Wolfknives names for a little bit, so we got to salute all the new members like Baby Cage, King Richard the Turd, Anal Suction, Death Box, Shit Stain, Alcoholica, and Nigeria. And if you&#8217;ve got some time to kill, patriotguard.org is down for technical problems so go watch porn or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freddie Roach got a call from GSP that he won&#8217;t fight again without Freddie in his corner. Ryan Parsons was in studio to talk MMA and whether or not GSP got thrown a fucking handout cause he&#8217;s a big name. And since I didn&#8217;t watch it, I can&#8217;t really give an opinion but god damn if the internet didn&#8217;t come to it&#8217;s own conclusion. The guys talked MMA technique and stuff for a while, and all the stuff that happened at UFC 167 this past weekend. Ryan got a skateboarding lesson from Jason years ago and ate more shit than Two Girls one cup, but he could still punch the jawbone clean off of anybody who was at the ramp that day. Something new in the world of fight sports is that Ryan is doing a study on the kinds of forces exerted against your hand in different kinds of blows, and they&#8217;re using the data to finally come up with something new in hand wraps and see what everybody&#8217;s best blows are so they can train to get the most use out of them. Of course, with all the talk of punching shit it just wouldn&#8217;t be right not to have Ryan take a stab at it. But more importantly, he&#8217;s gotta do it his own version show punch-o-meter that may actually be a quality piece of equipment that gives numbers worth listing. And before that, Jason got a lesson on how badly he fails at wrapping his hands when he trains. Rawdog was the first to try the new punch machine and landed a sweet score of 1,740 watts! But unfortunately the world record is somewhere near 84,000, so not impressive to put out in the low thousands. Tully gave it a shot and landed somewhere in the low 10k&#8217;s, so definitely not a man to ignore if he&#8217;s swinging at you. Ellis&#8217; highest was right around 53,000 and Wu-Tang clan ain&#8217;t nothing to fuck with. The guys talked fighting some more and how much sense these new technologically advanced hand wraps work and how smart people are always gonna be needed to make new ways for stupid people do things better. There were some more strength tests and stuff and Tully could probably come pretty close to choking Rawdog to death with one hand, and Josh probably couldn&#8217;t crush an apricot. On a more surprising note, Ellis scored between the other two, but way closer to Rawdog. After all the chest pounding and animal grunts, the guys talked for a while about how all this science is applied practically in the real world of fight sports and it sounds like it would be a pretty interesting set of numbers to look over if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing. The scientist that Ryan brought along weighed in on all the research and stuff they were doing and threatened to give Rawdog a muscle biopsy, but after seeing the coax cable sized needle they would need to use to take a sample, it was pretty universally agreed that some things are really close to that fine line between comedy and physical abuse. This brought about talk of testosterone replacement therapy and how HGH doesn&#8217;t work for shit unless you haven&#8217;t gotten your puberty growth spurt yet. There&#8217;s research that shows that people with PTSD benefit highly from doing mixed martial arts, so much so that it&#8217;s becoming part of the therapy for returning veterans, and since the veterans don&#8217;t get nearly the help they should then why not have them do something good for themselves?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tully prepared a speech for his bid to become the new Prime Minister of Canada, but first, Mexico is the fattest country in the world! Just barely inching out all the previous contenders, who are all floating somewhere around 65-70% population fatness. But more important, back to Canada, a Canadian fan stopped by the studio to hang out with the guys and hear what makes Tully think he can run the friendliest country in the world. The most important parts of this are that Rawdog was the one who wrote the speech, and in honor of what Tully may think he did a great job. Some talking points to note:</p>
<p>1. Canada is a native word that means &#8220;land.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. It&#8217;s the twinkle in a child&#8217;s eye when he tells his mother FUCK YOU!!!</p>
<p>3. Tully will cut taxes and double down on all kinds of free shit for the canucks.</p>
<p>4. God Bless America, and then Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian guest said he wouldn&#8217;t vote for Tully, so Rawdog&#8217;s back up career seems pretty well fucked right out of the gate, but he&#8217;ll get another shot if Ellis lets him write his speech for asking Scott Greenstein for a raise. Jodi (the Canadian) talked for a while about some research he&#8217;s doing about PTSD and some of the new therapies and stuff that are being used on it. He&#8217;s a veteran and has seen some heavy shit and knows a thing or two about therapy and what works and doesn&#8217;t when you&#8217;re trying to get back to a normal working state of mind. There&#8217;s been some experimenting with robot therapists (Josh came all over himself hearing that) and the results so far have been pretty awesome. The guys turned to the phones for final calls and like most days, there were plenty of people worth hanging up on but you can all go vote for the reverse awards and sign up to ellismania.com to watch dirtbike shit and even good old fashioned anal porn with a chick screaming RED DRAGONS on insertion! Or you could go to patriotguard.org and keep clicking refresh until they&#8217;ve got their hardware problems worked out.</p>

<p>Here it is, what you&#8217;ve been waiting all weekend for. It&#8217;s Monday, Monday, MONDAY! Live, from the planet earth, it&#8217;s The Jason Ellis Show Recap! Get it in ya! MONSTER RECAP MONDAAAAY! Alright, you sold on it yet? I&#8217;m sold on it. Do you say &#8220;effin&#8221; or &#8220;friggin&#8221; or &#8220;freakin&#8221; or some variation there-of for &#8220;fuckin&#8221;? I understand. Sometimes you gotta do it, but sometimes you gotta let that genie out of the bottle, too. Try it. Say it. I&#8217;ll wait for you. Somebody said something about Katie&#8217;s laugh on Jason&#8217;s Instagram and he almost told that person that their neck was pregnant, but he didn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s not going to waste his &#8220;effin&#8221; time being all bitter and mean and &#8220;shibbidy&#8221;. Dingo got to hear about sweaty hands and Brian Deegan and how much time and energy Deegan used to waste on a hating. Bloods and Crips, one of them is better than the other, Wilson is part of MS13, Rawdog ain&#8217;t scurred of any of them because he&#8217;s Jewish for life, and Tully thinks Hollywood is really just a giant shithole. His new neighbors were scoping him out since they&#8217;re the new kids on the block and the neighbors are wondering if that means their hood is turning to shit. <a href="https://twitter.com/BetsyEnglish" target="_blank">Betsy</a> is donating $7,500 to charity like some kind of badass &#8211; which is fucking badass &#8211; therefore she&#8217;s badass. But nobody can figure out why she likes the show because she&#8217;s got way more class than anyone there. Tiggy&#8217;s still bringing the pain to the dirty, stinking, red headed kid at soccer. He scored 8 goals, thereby solidifying his first major step in becoming the next David Beckham. He&#8217;s definitely already surpassed Rawdog, who had the most soccer balls stolen from him during a game. How are professional athletes making so much money and getting so many breaks? Even though they&#8217;re rich as fuck and have a glamorous life, a lot of them end up broke as shit. Cry me a &#8220;effin&#8221; river.</p>
<div id="attachment_6184" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oh_im_so_scared.gif" target="_blank"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6184" class=" wp-image-6184" alt="oh_im_so_scared" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oh_im_so_scared.gif" width="240" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oh_im_so_scared.gif 640w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oh_im_so_scared-300x168.gif 300w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oh_im_so_scared-500x281.gif 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6184" class="wp-caption-text">Bomb threat? TJES ain&#8217;t scurred.</p></div>
<p>Breaking news with Wilson Pendarvis! The cops have the building surrounded and the streets blocked off because of a suspicious looking package / potential bomb threat. Which of course means that TJES could literally be on the verge of blowing the fuck up. Will&#8217;s oddly looking out the window, listening to multiple police scanners, frantically pushing buttons on his massive phone, and praying a bomb will go off to end his pain and misery. Breaking Richmond family news with Rawdog! His sister Gabi, aka &#8220;The Tooth&#8221;, is now engaged and ready for an adulterous relationship soon. Just kidding. Congratulations to her clavicle breaking ass, but fuck her fiancé because none of us know him. He could be a sweet dude, but we&#8217;ll never know. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/g1JIm9i_mu/" target="_blank">Ellis took the kids and Katie horseback riding over the weekend</a>. And just like you&#8217;d imagine someone named &#8220;The King of The West&#8221; would do, he took a cell phone call while riding and did an interview over the phone. Hey, did you know Ellis used to skateboard? Yup, he sure did. He also watched the Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth show this weekend, as did I, and it was fucking great. Circling back around to professional athletes and how stupid they are with money, everyone had their butthole clinch a bit when Tyson talked about being charged $8,000 for towels. Not because they were awesome towels, but because he wasn&#8217;t watching what shit-dick Don King was doing with Tyson&#8217;s money.</p>
<div id="attachment_6183" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gsp_face.jpg" target="_blank"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6183" class=" wp-image-6183" alt="gsp_face" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gsp_face.jpg" width="240" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gsp_face.jpg 640w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gsp_face-300x196.jpg 300w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gsp_face-457x300.jpg 457w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6183" class="wp-caption-text">It hurts not so much here or here, but all over.</p></div>
<p>UFC news time, Rawdog did not watch it, GSP retained his title against Johny Hendricks (who spells Johnny with 1 N?), even though a ton of people thought he lost, including Dana White. A lot of GSP fans are pissed that anyone has an issue with him winning, of course, and apparently those people don&#8217;t like anyone to have an opinion that differs from their own. <a href="http://youtu.be/h2x8OSpONKU" target="_blank">Dana was livid with the decision and blamed The Nevada State Athletic Commission</a>, saying &#8220;<em>they have a lot of work to do, that they make him sick, and they better figure out how to not destroy, not only the sport of boxing, but this sport, too.</em>&#8221; <a href="http://youtu.be/wtdENiV6oBc" target="_blank">Hendricks also weighed in on the matter</a> and says he doesn&#8217;t care if GSP retires or not, he just wants what is clearly his, the belt. Josh Koscheck was brutally knocked out by Tyron Woodley in the first round, leaving many to question if Koscheck has the chin for MMA anymore. Chael Sonnen was man-handled by Rashad Evans on Saturday, eventually leading to a knockout of Sonnen, which left me shrugging my shoulders because I&#8217;m not a big fan of either of those guys. But I&#8217;d say Chael needs to stick to his TV game and by the looks from the fight, Rashad probably has a chance to stick around fighting for awhile. Robbie Lawler won his fight with Rory MacDonald in a decision left to the judges. And finally, according to Dana White, Jon Jones has withdrew from UFC 170 due to injuries.</p>
<div id="attachment_6188" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/proud.gif" target="_blank"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6188" class="size-full wp-image-6188" alt="proud" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/proud.gif" width="240" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/proud.gif 245w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/proud-229x300.gif 229w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6188" class="wp-caption-text">A proud Wilson in his new Red Dragons jeans.</p></div>
<p>In other big news, your Ugg boots, the ones made out of sheep skin? Yeah, they&#8217;re made out of sheep skin and a sheep has to die for you to look ridiculous. Okay, that doesn&#8217;t actually qualify for big news, but this does. Next Tuesday, November 26th is the release party for Big Fucking Mega Boat, with a live show at some go kart track and everyone is invited, even Wilson. According to local Thailand expert, Dingo, those people are greasy and he used to be full of grease as a young boy in Thailand. NFL news time with expert professional football statistician, Rawdog. Peyton (nay Paytaun) Manning threw the ball towards other guys that were themselves running towards the goal. There was a 2 hour windy mud delay in Chicago creating what might have been the longest football game in the history of tennis. Somebody kicked a field goal and then they won. Stealers beat the Lions by going hard in the paint for rebounds. Wilson is sporting some Red Dragons jeans that make his butt look incredible and cause people to scream Red Dragons anytime he passes by shaking his money maker. Just ask Katie. And Ashley. And your mom.</p>
<p>Jason says the show is repping Onnit hardcore, but oddly, they never mentioned a <a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/contest/" target="_blank">contest sponsored by Onnit because Onnit wants to give back to TJES fans</a>. Strange, because you&#8217;d think a shitball website dedicated to TJES &amp; running a contest by Onnit would be worthy of a mention, but nooooo. (Calm down, it&#8217;s a joke.) Anyway. This brought us into an episode of &#8220;You sir, are a moron.&#8221; The first topic up, should you have the right to burn the American flag? Next topic, how many times jerking off in one day is too many? Next, who is the most over-rated musician of all time? Next, would you turn your mom in if she killed someone? And then, what if your wife had an outtie belly button? I think there was another one before that, but I missed it. Next, is it wrong to give money to organizations like PETA? And finally, what is the highest job in &#8220;office&#8221; (political) would anyone on the show be qualified to hold? So there ya go, questions without answers to keep you up at night. But good news, I have one more question, this time with an answer to help give you closure. What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor? He cried because his wife got it in the divorce, along with the farm, his 3 kids, his happiness, his money, and his dog named Tim. Oh and his dignity. And there you have it. &#8220;Don&#8217;t die&#8221; is Ellis&#8217; saying, so I&#8217;ll end this recap in my own way, while saying pretty much the same thing.</p>

From what I could gather they were talking about disciplining kids, cussing, and a broken racketeering. As far as the raising kids thing goes, my personal opinion is that if you don&#8217;t discipline them then they turn into assholes, but if you beat the shit out of them they turn into assholes, so just find a happy medium. Or don&#8217;t have kids. As far as the broken racketeering goes, I know nothing officer, I was just walking by and these are not my pants. I came in at Cullen&#8217;s phone call, I really wasn&#8217;t sure what he was talking about but he sounded good as he always does and I&#8217;m sure that it was very interesting and educational. Then there was a music break.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of the Batkid in San Francisco story, then you are living in a tunnel in the Great White North and have eyes too beady to be capable of reading the newspaper. If you haven&#8217;t heard about it, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/batkid-san-francisco-charity-make-wish">here it is, in larger print for my frozen friends to the north.</a> Ellis</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">saw Thor last night and despite all the shit he talked about it he liked it. The only thing he didn&#8217;t like is when they over did it with the CGI. Forest Griffin called in with a little story about he got fully aroused by a heavy set hairdresser while she washed his hair. Also that he really didn&#8217;t get 15 shoulder surgeries, they were really 15 penis enlargement surgeries. He talked about the 20 years in the UFC documentary and he didn&#8217;t like it because,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I look like a complete doofus</em>&#8221; &#8211; Forest Griffin</p>
<p>He is also driving the Scion he won from The Ultimate Fighter in 2005 and apparently is using a cell phone from 2005 as well. As this phone call went on it only got better, mainly because I imagined Forest at a carnival in China Town. After Forests call there were a couple callers that needed help. One dude was a pothead that hasn&#8217;t spoken to his dad for a couple years because he called him a dead beat. The other dude was getting high on pain killers and booze because he got way low after his dad died. Get help, it&#8217;s hard, run towards your problems.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="deathdeathdie.com">DeathDeathDie.com</a> to order the new album, BIG FUCKING MEGA BOAT THE MOVIE: THE SOUNDTRACK<br />
<a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/infomercial_ellismania.com_.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6166" alt="infomercial_ellismania.com" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/infomercial_ellismania.com_.gif" width="380" height="277" /></a><br />
A man bought the house right next to his ex wife and then <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/11/15/giant-bronze-middle-finger-pops-up-in-bloomfield-hills/">erected a giant middle finger</a> pointing at her. Jason brought in a new game, Devin and Tiger had to described someone without saying who it was and the guys had to guess what they were describing. It ended up being a steaming pile of shit, adorable, but a pile none the less. Thankfully they have another bit, Beans Death Corner, inspired by Bean of Kevin and Bean. These are awesome stories of people who died in odd, unusual, or amusing ways. It was hysterical. Okay not really but you can be fucking sure I&#8217;m checking the railing on every balcony I go on!</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/29/slurry_fetish_pervert_jailed/">man with shit fetish</a> got arrested again for breaking a restraining order that a farmer put against his after repeatedly breaking into his farm and getting naked and rolling in the cow shit. Oh and one time he set the farm on fire. Have you seen the Van Damme&#8217;s video <a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images-14.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6174" alt="images (14)" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images-14.jpg" width="240" height="200" /></a>where he does the spits on top of a couple of semis? Well I don&#8217;t care, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7FIvfx5J10">here it it and look at his bulge!</a> Some place in some city <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/177543/tattoo-parlors-packed-for-free-swastika-day.html">did some shit with swastikas but not in a hateful way</a> and imagine everybody&#8217;s amazement when the Jewish community got upset. Scientist discovered the worlds oldest animal, a mollusk, but when they were discovering the age of this thing <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/15/newser-worlds-oldest-animal/3574863/">they killed it</a>. Then they put lemon juice on it and a little Tobasco and slurped that sweet sweet puppy down. They did a whole bunch more news stories and I was paying attention until I stopped at Walmart and this really fat lady was yelling at her really skinny boyfriend about something that I couldn&#8217;t quite make out but it was very entertaining and kept me occupied for the better end of seven minutes. I&#8217;m pretty sure she ate him that night. There&#8217;s a professor somewhere that found out that all the 50 Shades Of Grey books <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/14/professors-test-fifty-shades-of-grey-library-book-find-it-has-traces-of-herpes/">contain traces of the herpes virus, kida like a gift for buying it</a>. All the rest of the books just had traces of cocaine in them like they&#8217;re supposed to. Speaking of trace amounts of cocaine and the herpes virus, the very last caller would like to thank everybody for bringing the sexual adventure back into his bedroom and how he is constantly droppin loads everywhere, and on behalf of NYA we&#8217;d like to tell yer dad, you&#8217;re welcome, OH!</p>

			<p>So have you ever wondered what life is about? What it all means? What it&#8217;s like to have two dicks in your mouth at the same time. I bet it&#8217;s exhausting and uncomfortable. Much like life when you try to take on too much and don&#8217;t slow down to enjoy the simple things,</p>
<div id="attachment_6160" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images-13.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6160" class="size-full wp-image-6160" alt="Two Girls, One Lizard" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images-13.jpg" width="262" height="192" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6160" class="wp-caption-text">Two Girls, One Lizard</p></div>
<p>like one dick in your mouth. This applies to everybody, except Sasha Grey, she loves to have dicks crammed in her mouth like a dick mouth cramming machine. But some people like many many dicks in them, that&#8217;s not wrong, it&#8217;s just their thing and if that&#8217;s cool with them then that&#8217;s cool with me. They talked about many fetishes and how some of the things that seemed forbidden and taboo twenty years ago are pretty much normal now. And in the interest of normal, Baby Man called in and said that he and his wife get off on him acting like a baby and pissing himself and chillin in a giant crib. There are many other fetishes that people are into like peeing on each other, bondage, spanking, dressing as a magical liger from the land of boners, and other completely normal and healthy sexual ventures.</p>
<p>Did you watch The Ultimate Fighter last night? I didn&#8217;t, I was busy making fun of the people who are trying to find Bigfoot but I recorded it so no spoilers. Apparently everyone is being a whiney little bitch and they hate this one girl because she is wining and the rest of them are not. I also believe that all the women in the house have started their periods at the same time because according to the internet that shit happens. Red Tide. Brian Deegan (<a href="https://twitter.com/mmgeneral">@mmgeneral</a>) came into the studio to talk about all kinds of shit. He talked about being in the LOORS, thats Lucas Oil Offroad Racing Series for you sissy girls, and how he&#8217;s trying to move to pro something from pro something else. He also talked about the Lucas Oil Championships the he won, black flag (not the band apparently), and feeling with your ass. There was some other Australian bloke that likes to party in the snow there with them.</p>
<div id="attachment_6161" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deegan-with-Haiden.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6161" class="size-medium wp-image-6161" alt="You think your kids awesome, bet he doesn't have a GoPro video to prove it!" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deegan-with-Haiden-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deegan-with-Haiden-300x200.jpg 300w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deegan-with-Haiden-449x300.jpg 449w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deegan-with-Haiden.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6161" class="wp-caption-text">You think your kids awesome, bet he doesn&#8217;t have a GoPro video to prove it!</p></div>
<p>Apparently this dude is some kick ass X-Games mother fucker, I&#8217;d give you more information but I&#8217;m lazy and you don&#8217;t really care anyway and these are not the droids you&#8217;re looking for. They also talked about Ken Block. A lot. So much that now I have an urge to name my next born child Ken Block. Speaking of Ken Block, Deegan (<a href="http://instagram.com/briandeegan38">briandeegan38</a>) and Twitch used to be friends, then they weren&#8217;t, but they&#8217;re back to being friends now so happy days are here again. As great, and long, as this interview was my app timed out and restarted with Butt Town. As much as I&#8217;m interested in the last bit of Deegan and hearing how his kid is better than everyone else I think I&#8217;ll just move on.</p>
<p>Aussie news on a Perth freeway a man was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--xsIAbP6yk">caught on a dash cam head butting cars</a>. Woman turned down a dudes marriage proposal so the dude <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2507049/Woman-turned-older-mans-offer-marriage-stunned-115-000-hes-spent-her.html">sent her a bill for two </a><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/download-7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6164" alt="download (7)" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/download-7.jpg" width="275" height="183" /></a>hundred grand for everything he spent courting her. Also in amazing news from an Australian, other channels on SiriusXm are now promoting <a href="http://www.ellismania.com/">Ellismania.com </a>on their channels. A man in London got arrested for <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/12/premier-inn-guest-hurled-racist-abuse-with-fire-extinguisher-hose-up-his-bottom-4184507/">shoving a fire extinguisher up his butt</a>, fondling himself, and stripping naked. He also claimed the entire country is being invaded by Al Qaeda and pissed on the floor. This dude parties better than you. Speaking of parties, I am the master of segways with this shit I swear, they did Wolfknife names next! They were awesome, so awesome that I forgot to write any of them down for you. Sucks to be you! But thank god there are replays in the morning and maybe you can hear it there, unless you&#8217;re one of the three guys bitching about it, then you can go fuck yourself with your sisters dick. Final calls happened, much</p>
<div id="attachment_6163" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2b8.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6163" class="size-full wp-image-6163" alt="My reaction to your Wolfknife name." src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2b8.gif" width="300" height="225" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6163" class="wp-caption-text">My reaction to your Wolfknife name.</p></div>
<p>like it happens every day, and much like everyday, the callers are shit tards and don&#8217;t know how to ask intelligent questions let alone are able to talk when their name is mentioned. Oh and Ellis&#8217;s insurance company keeps jacking him around with the Porsche dealership repair shop and getting his car fixed. They took a look at the charts and something and figure that this new Death!Death!Die! album should be bigger than the Tainstick album, but that is neither here nor there, it&#8217;s a CD. That was a joke, maybe you should read it again. Did you get it? Oh well, this kind of comedy isn&#8217;t for everybody. Remember that no matter how hard life gets its never gonna be as hard as the thousands and thousands of dicks that have penetrated yer mums sockets, OH!</p>
