			<p>Holy fuck, they should make every weekend a three day weekend. I got so much masturba-&#8230;uh, housework done. It was just the free time I needed to soil two huge piles of clean clothes with my seme-&#8230;ummm, fold, I meant fold, not soil. I also was able to wash down my grimey ass stove with a layer of hot jizz. Not a typo. No corrections. I busted a can of spray on the stove. Welcome to Oakland, bitch. Anyways, it&#8217;s almost that magical time of the day when Faction stops letting shitty pop music get mixed in with their punk, metal and hip-hop, and Jason Ellis takes over to be all Australian and shit. Today&#8217;s show got started with talk about how having a huge cock should be something that people admire personally. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be a big public thing, but if you happen to get into porn, well then you&#8217;re just an egotistical asshole. Dingo was in the studio today, being the Dingo, as he&#8217;s known to do. He was at some EDC thing in New York over the weekend and if I cared at all about techno music I would have paid attention. Jude also was hanging out today and the guys talked beards and haircuts and how some proper grooming can take years off of your face. Unless you go for the beard implants, then you&#8217;re just an egotistical asshole. Tully broke it all down as an equation of how long people are trying to stay in the cool game nowadays, and how they&#8217;re all trying too god damn hard and just cause you know how to make a martini with an egg doesn&#8217;t mean your saggy balls are worth anybody&#8217;s time. The guys listened to some audio of Dingo talking to Cullen about his attempt last week at doing interviews at Street League for the show and how the audio sucked and Jason was a little too harsh about it. Jason apologized, and explained that @shit_toboggan could see lots of the fans on twitter sounded pretty bored with the whole thing, so it maybe wasn&#8217;t as much of a success as he was hoping for. Jude made sure to tell Dingo not to suck so bad at interviewing people and to check his god damn sound levels like he&#8217;s got some fucking idea what he&#8217;s doing and maybe the second try will be a little better. All joking aside though, Ellis, Jude and Tully shared a few war stories of fucked up remote sessions of years past and how it&#8217;s not always the host&#8217;s fault. Jude once had a porn star taste test his semen on air and forgot to turn on the microphones, but luckily it was against the rules of radio so #Allegedly it didn&#8217;t happen. This made Ellis recant that time he tried drinking his piss to try and be like Leo Machida, and he went into great detail about the distinct tang and self loathing that human urine creates when ingested orally. Jason is still healing from his heart surgery last week. He went to take a piss the other day and his stomach was abnormally swollen and he had bruises all around where the doctors went in through his groin to do stuff to his ticker. Jude let us all know that he&#8217;s pretty much perfected his ass washing technique, just gotta get some Irish Spring and a washcloth and don&#8217;t let anybody know how deep you fist yourself with that washcloth cause it could jeopardize your career in the hip hop industry. The guys talked for a while about ways to market Junkie Piss Popsicles, and all the different ways you could cross promote other cheap last resort ways to get high, like Syzzurp-sicles. And before we get too far off topic, styrofoam really does hold in the cold better than plastic Solo cups. Tully decided to scroll through Dingo&#8217;s Instagram photos to see if they could guess who he knows that drinks a lot of syzzurp, and while Dingo wouldn&#8217;t necessarily sell them out, there were some guesses that would certainly be believable to the average man with a decent grasp on pop culture. This was a perfect segue for Jude and Dingo to criticize Jason&#8217;s nose and give suggestions on how he should fix his mangled honker. After some discussion of plastic surgery, Ellis started thinking that if hair implants don&#8217;t work, it may be time to start investing in wigs. Jude gave his two cents on how people who get laser hair removal around the giblets are probably doing the world a disservice when they get older cause that&#8217;s when people are more likely to be inspecting that whole area. But on the plus side, America has won the war against crabs. No, not the ones from New England, I mean the ones that crawl on your nuts and fuck up a perfectly good set of sheets while making you itch so god damn hard you&#8217;ll rip your scrotum off if it would just make the pain stop. Jude started getting hot and bothered talking about Princess Leia in her slave outfit at Jabba&#8217;s Palace, which is when Ellis broke the news that he&#8217;s gonna get a dungeon so that he can consensually sexually abuse people. Dingo completely misunderstood what Jason meant by dungeon and started imagining a place with outside access to order a pizza, DirecTV and an Xbox. Like an in-law cottage or something off the back of someone&#8217;s house. Jude remembers one time when he went to a BDSM bar and came across a lady who was unnaturally tall but it turns out she just had a guy who would follow her around and lay down for her to stand on everywhere she went. That said, foreallyshow.com and the new release of Hyena should be out in a few months, so get the fuck on it. Tully tried to drive around the city giving out burgers but all the homeless people were on vacation and also his wife shut him the fuck down. Also, he tried to give one to a gay prostitute but his wife didn&#8217;t want a gay Mexican hooker following them home begging for scraps. The guys took some calls and stuff. There was some talk about a Grenade/Wolfknives crossover product of some sort, then Dingo brought up a picture Katie put on Instagram of a fake penis tattoo on her foot that Kelly Osbourne saw. Somebody has been obsessively tweeting a petition to save the rhinos at Ellis and Dingo and the guys talked for a while about how stupid it is to drive an entire species out of existence just cause you think that rhino horn is gonna give you a stronger erection. The guys all aired out the massively overgrown pubes adorning their hippie vags and had an environmental awareness session to remind the human race that it really is our fault for everything, and it&#8217;s kind of true except for the few who try to make a difference. Tully found a news story about the guy who invented Soylent (which will surely cause him a lawsuit for plagiarizing the name of the famous Charlton Heston movie) and how it would be good for the world as a whole if more people could climb on board with the whole &#8220;drink all of your meals in a slightly semen-like concoction that an overworked programmer came up with because he couldn&#8217;t be bothered to go grocery shopping and cook properly&#8221; train. Fucking nutrients and shit. Remember when I mentioned Ellis&#8217; swollen stomach? Well apparently he&#8217;s also had apocalyptic flatulence for the last few days. Chicken-egg, something like that, but all the same he&#8217;s a model rocket engine waiting for a light. While we all laugh to ourselves about other people&#8217;s intestinal disfunctions, let&#8217;s have some awesome world to remind us that heaven has naked bitches and chocolate everywhere and a pretty sweet ramp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOTO NEWS YA BEE-YIE-ITCH!!! Some guys rode some dirtbikes at Glen Helen over the weekend, and a good time was had by all. The guys talked about how much people in TV need to maybe give it a rest, like Oprah Winfrey and that god damn Lindsay Lohan show that really doesn&#8217;t give any important information or solve any problems or exist for any reason other than existing. Somebody sent in a sweet little RC car ramp for Jason to jump those cars that Ken Block gave him. In particular today, the ramps were used as a testing session for a future wheel of doom loser who would have to lie down the long way between the launch and landing and see if the cars could clear it. With Cumtard being the show&#8217;s whipping post for now and probably all time, he was the one to get in the hot seat to see if these miniature machines can fly as hard and far as they are assumed to be able to. After a few rough runs in practice, with coming up short and front flips and smashing the fuck out of Dingo&#8217;s knee and all kinds of other mishaps, Kevin finally got in place to make his attempt not to lose a testicle for the show, and in true tard fashion he decided to guard his face instead, but luckily for him the car got right over him with no great catastrophes. The guys talked for a bit about the UFC fights that happened this weekend and that one guy who kept fighting despite his ankle being shattered and not just kept fighting but KICKED SOME FUCKIN&#8217; ASS!!! There was more MMA talk as there tends to be whenever the topic comes up. I went out for dinner last night and wound up watching a few minutes of MMA with some folks over outrageously overpriced burgers and a milkshake that ended up being more calories than I&#8217;m used to but absolutely delicious and satisfying at the same time. So there&#8217;s that, fighting and red meat. As much as I talk about leaving America, I did partake in two of our oldest pastimes. That said, the guys decided to take a break which was promptly derailed by malfunctioning equipment at SiriusXM in which they fucked up a Beatles song, and a bumper, and then a Machine Head song, but in the end it sorted itself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAVE YOU BEEN TO HATEBEAN.COM?!?!?! It basically just links to the one HateBean shirt on Ellis&#8217; website, but before that, you can read some incredible slack-jawed engrish that will surely put a smile on your face. Before you do that though, Doug Benson came by the studio to hang out for a while. They talked accents and how Jason can occasionally turn his off when he needs it and Dingo tried to be an American but it was like a New York Jew from the 23rd layer of hell. Jason told the story of how he was talking to a friend from the motherland and was really shook by just how Australian he was. Doug noticed that there was a box of kleenex, a bottle of purell, and a blu-ray copy of the Korean version of the movie Old Boy, and that brought up the question have you ever jerked off with purell? And if so, how bad does it sting? Dougs answer was yes, and I didn&#8217;t start smoking weed till 28 when I was a comic on the road. While Jason was cleaning up the shelf he couldn&#8217;t help but notice that there was other weird crap on their like nuts, dental floss, a timer, and all kinds of other chotchkies that apparently didn&#8217;t get the memo that there would be no chotchkies in the new studio. The guys talked for a bit about how purell is a steaming load of commercialist fear mongering and how WILSON needs to stop napping on the torture couch and get himself a real apartment, even though he&#8217;s never gonna be there cause he works 72 hours a day. The boys talked psychology and how it&#8217;s really stupid that there&#8217;s a guy who can give you a reference to the guy who&#8217;s gonna give you the actual treatment, and how the guy who gives you the treatment could at least pretend to be a little more interested in performing some sort of treatment on another person&#8217;s mental state so they don&#8217;t have sleepwalking murder episodes. A psychological professional called in to explain the difference between all the psychological professionals and what their different ranks mean and it made enough sense, aside from the fact that no one can figure out which one gets to say when you can stop dumping medication in your face. Doug got called out for being really friendly with the porn community, but still complaining that he&#8217;s not getting laid often enough, and he responded by demanding a lie detector test. Basically, he wants his blow jobs to have some feeling behind them, and not just a love of sucking dick or crystal meth or proving someone&#8217;s dad right. And fuck what you heard, comedians don&#8217;t have groupies. The group basically settled the whole matter by coming up with a game where Doug tears through a slew of hot ladies and the world holds up their hands for for him to high five at his leisure. And if that fails, Bonnie Rotten and Ronda Rousey get to fight for the Benson dick. Or maybe Doug can just plow through a whole bunch of his fans, cause they&#8217;re great people in his eyes and he loves hanging out with them, so if they happen to want to blow him, he&#8217;s pretty much got the pick of the litter. Doug told a few stories about getting kicked out of hotels for smoking weed in the rooms, and swimming with sharks, and how to cook up the best romantic getaway for him to share a bongload with the victor of the &#8220;Win Doug Benson&#8217;s Semen&#8221; death match that will almost surely be part of EllisMania 10. There was some talk about what celebrities would be best to invite onto Doug&#8217;s YouTube show &#8220;Getting Doug With High&#8221; and there have been some memorable ones, like David Cross and Eric Andre, but some of the suggestions floated were for the likes of Nick Swardson (who probably wouldn&#8217;t because he drinks too much to smoke weed) and Joe Rogan (who probably wouldn&#8217;t cause he tends to run his own performance more than anything else). The guys took a break so Doug could get some water and Cheetos, then came back with a game for Doug to join in with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, unsigned bands still happens from time to time, and might be happening again soon, so send your shit in to submittoellis@gmail.com and you might get a week of unsolicited airplay between noon and 4PM on a satellite radio station. Someone sent in a burnout video of a guy who had purple smoke tires, which I have seen and they are a hilarious addition to any burnout video or drift compilation. I know Kumho Tire makes red, yellow, and blue, but I haven&#8217;t seen the purple ones. There&#8217;s a couple other companies that make them too, but only for select wheel sizes, so if you feel like adding to these YouTube sensations of rubber shredding destruction, order yourself a pair and fire up the go-pro. That said, IT&#8217;S TIME FOR ELLIS JEOPARDY!!! As is par for the course, it&#8217;s hilarious to hear a dyslexic Australian try to describe things for other people to figure out, especially when one of the people is a career pothead and another one is an Australian who always seems a bit off track with what&#8217;s going on in his immediate vicinity, unless it&#8217;s something radical. Frogs are lubey, Doug wants Bonnie Rotten to taste the golden spray, Tully is a pot smoker bordering on addict levels, Whitney Houston is still dead but was wasted like a mother fucker all the way, Dingo can&#8217;t keep his dick out of frogs, Chong is constantly cock-blocking Cheech, Yoda is more grey than green but still pretty green, XXX: State Of The Union would have been impossible cause Ice Cube doesn&#8217;t have the arm span to jump off a building and grab a helicopter, The Breakfast Club was a classic but it really did bomb for a good reason before it reached cult classic status, Jaws really didn&#8217;t need any sequels but when has that ever stopped Hollywood from letting them happen, Bill Murray has jungle fever, and there were no final calls cause Tony Hawk was live and Jeopardy took the whole final hour. Now go stick it so far up your ass you can blow your nose with it.</p>

			<div id="attachment_12263" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/do-what-what-do-i-do-again.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12263 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/do-what-what-do-i-do-again.gif" alt="do-what-what-do-i-do-again" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What&#8217;s that? I rolled it again? Oh, you didn&#8217;t want me to roll it? What?</p></div>
<p><a href="http://instagram.com/p/oH043dC_lQ/" target="_blank">Yardsale is back!</a> For today anyway, tomorrow he gets his heart welded on and he&#8217;ll need at least 1 day to recover. It&#8217;s fucking heart surgery man, so don&#8217;t be upset if dude takes a few days off. If it were me, I wouldn&#8217;t even be in today, I&#8217;d be too much of a wreck to stop puking and shitting. Anyway, you know how he went to race this weekend? Yeah, he rolled his ride again, at least he went most of the race and rolled half way through the last lap. He was 10th out of 18 at that point. But hey, he qualified 17th and at one point was 8th, so that&#8217;s doing pretty good for not really being a racer. Besides, <a href="http://jalopnik.com/heres-ken-blocks-crazy-ass-fiery-flip-from-the-barbados-1578408509" target="_blank">Ken Block crashed this weekend too</a>, so there&#8217;s that. The main point here is that he had fun. Apparently TJ Lavin did pretty well and Ronnie Faisst sucked. Ellis is trying to stay excited about getting his heart surgery, Tully is excited, and all of Dingo&#8217;s innards are revolted at the idea. Dingo was a Jason Ellis Show correspondent at the Street League event this weekend, but we&#8217;ll get to that later. Ellis forgot to go on cam this morning like he planned to do each week, but seriously, what&#8217;s up with parking tickets in LA, am I right? Speaking of LA, there&#8217;s some traveling show about Pompeii or some shit. Why is that a touring festival? That seems weird. It&#8217;s like Burning Man, but with lava, pyroclastic flows, and death and shit. I hiked into Haleakalā crater once. Worst experience ever. I thought I was gonna die. Who knew a smoker, hiking out of a crater that doesn&#8217;t want to let you leave, in thin-ass air, above the clouds,  not wearing sunblock, wouldn&#8217;t do so hot in that situation? Looked awesome hiking down, but hiking up was pure hell. Anyway, I&#8217;ve gotten side tracked. So dudes, is there a chick you would lock down by getting pregnant? We&#8217;re talking you put holes in your condom, but don&#8217;t tell the chick so she &#8220;mysteriously&#8221; gets pregnant and has to stay with you. I guess you have to be clear on your motives. I chose Oprah just so I could make her best friend, Gayle, jealous and be there to watch their relationship deteriorate. Anyway, since Ellis has been thinking about life lately with his upcoming heart surgery, everyone on the show came up with a bucket list over the weekend. But before we get to that, let&#8217;s take a moment to realize that Dingo has his own personalized stationary. Fucking. Amazing. Now, on to the bucket lists&#8230; after this!</p>
<div id="attachment_12265" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ink-and-personal-lubricant.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12265 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ink-and-personal-lubricant.gif" alt="ink-and-personal-lubricant" width="568" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tired of sitting at work, needing to masturbate, but not having any personal lubricant? Now there&#8217;s KY Ink! Sold at stores near you!</p></div>
<p>And we&#8217;re back! <a href="http://daddu.net/7-jobs-highest-suicide-rates/" target="_blank">Wanna know which 7 jobs have the highest suicide rates?</a> Well just for you, I have the answers! I mean, someone else has the answers, but I can at least link you to them, so that kinda counts, right? What&#8217;s up with #7 on the list? The rest made sense to me, but #7 left me confused. So what&#8217;s the remedy for all these people in high suicide rate jobs? Get naked and hug a tree. Just go with it, man. Ellis ain&#8217;t got time for shit, except putting air in his tires. Turns out, he doesn&#8217;t have time for that either because people be blocking the air pump. Then the gas station attendant wouldn&#8217;t turn the air compressor on. DAMN THE MAN! Or at least damn the man working at Art&#8217;s 76 on Hollywood Blvd. Allegedly. Anyway, on to the bucket lists.</p>
<div id="attachment_12266" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tree-lover.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12266 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tree-lover.gif" alt="tree-lover" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dave!

<p>Next up, what kind of unusual shit have you fucked? After this!</p>
<div id="attachment_12269" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/we-paid-good-money-for-these-kids.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12269 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/we-paid-good-money-for-these-kids.gif" alt="we-paid-good-money-for-these-kids" width="360" height="204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Carol &amp; Jeff paid good money for these trafficked kids, only to find out the kids are broken. Don&#8217;t let this be you. Buy your slightly used kids from Nike!</p></div>
<p>And we&#8217;re back! Ellis will be live on his website at 7PM. Every Monday at 7PM and every Wednesday morning at 8AM. All times are Pacific. So eat a piece of dog shit, you sum bitches! Ellis&#8217; beard is getting really big, it&#8217;s grown up right before his eyes. Dingo doesn&#8217;t like it, he refuses to kiss a grape from Ellis&#8217; face with that monstrosity. Get this shit. The <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0519/618317-castrillo-matajudios/" target="_blank">Spanish town of Fort Kill Jews is set to vote on a name change</a>, the proposed new name? Fort Hill of Jews. Not much of an improvement. Police say <a href="http://www.wkrn.com/story/25554171/police-man-tried-to-have-sex-with-atm-picnic-table" target="_blank">a man in Murfreesboro, TN tried to have sex with an ATM and later a picnic table</a>. Wood on wood, that&#8217;s a recipe for fire. Tiger &amp; Devin aren&#8217;t getting along lately and need some separation time. Ellis woke up with a pee boner. Someone&#8217;s watching porn and it&#8217;s not an adult. And that is a good segue into the unusual things callers have fucked. In no particular order:</p>
<div id="attachment_12270" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/youll-hump-this-and-like-it.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12270 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/youll-hump-this-and-like-it.gif" alt="youll-hump-this-and-like-it" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You ready? We&#8217;re gonna fuck this Big Mac! No? What about this pickle? Why not? You can&#8217;t be so picky!</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Prosthetic titties in a dressing room. He came on the titties. Think about that the next time you&#8217;re trying on jeans.</li>
<li>A pickle. Yes, the food item. He says it was like a little green pocket pussy. Nothing like a Kosher Dill to get you in the mood!</li>
<li>A Big Mac. A fucking McDonald&#8217;s Big Mac. He only did it once though, so it&#8217;s cool, right?</li>
<li>A friend&#8217;s mom&#8217;s underwear. It&#8217;s no Big Mac, but it has potential to be pretty gamy. I&#8217;m not terrified by this one.</li>
<li>A medical doll. Like the kind you practice medical shit on, putting catheters in, etc. And he finished in it. This guy was a security guard. In other words, a serial rapist / killer in training.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dingo is totally cool with being nude or having sex in front of people he knows really well. Was this a hint at his willingness to participate in a potential ten-some, or maybe just sit in the dark corner, watching it all go down, and jerking off to it. Bellator 120 fights were this weekend. Does anyone give a shit? How is Bellator even still around? I don&#8217;t know, go Google that shit. Speaking of shit, next up is our man on the beat with his ear to the street reporting not live from Street League, Dingo! But first&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_12273" style="width: 494px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/toothpaste-cpr.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12273 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/toothpaste-cpr.gif" alt="toothpaste-cpr" width="484" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Are you raising little shits that think it&#8217;s funny to practice CPR on a tube of toothpaste? Great news! Now you can hire Wanda, the meanest bitch this side of hell. She&#8217;ll teach them through the ancient art of ridicule and physical punishment. They&#8217;ll get to watch nothing but Judge Judy and CSPAN. They&#8217;ll eat what they&#8217;re given or they&#8217;ll starve. By the time your little monkeys are back, they&#8217;ll be addressing you as &#8220;Lord&#8221; or &#8220;Lady&#8221; and helping to clean the house, even messes they didn&#8217;t create! Act now!</p></div>
<p>And we&#8217;re back! Remember when Christian came with the lyrical only version of Katy Perry&#8217;s &#8220;Firework&#8221; and Ellis put out the call for people to pump that shit in traffic with their windows rolled down and Instagram it? Well it&#8217;s going to happen again. But this time, try to really get people to notice and react &#8211; but do it nicely. It&#8217;s meant to brighten up someone&#8217;s day, not a chance for you to be a rude dick. You could win a Wolfknives package and/or a Red Dragons package. And now, over to the extreme sports desk with Dingo. Wait, scratch that &#8211; technical difficulties. Wait. No. Scratch that too. Technical difficulties have been fixed. Shit. Wait. No. The audio is not up to Ellis&#8217; standards, it&#8217;s not Dingo&#8217;s fault, this isn&#8217;t his job and he&#8217;s not used to this recording stuff. Poor Dingo. He tried and got a lot of people there to give him a minute or two to talk to him for the show. But it just wasn&#8217;t cutting the mustard so it was breezed by quickly and cut short. Sorry Dings. Time to talk to callers. Or maybe not. Not unless there&#8217;s a guy who had sexual relations with a dead chick. Also, Catheter Ablation, look for the new hit single this summer! I&#8217;m just gonna end it here because my daughter has some important shit to tell me about Butterfinger cups. Everyone here at NYA is wishing Ellis the best of luck with his surgery tomorrow and for a speedy, but more importantly, successful and healthy recovery! We&#8217;ll have our #1 guy back as soon as possible I&#8217;m sure. All hail the king of the west!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s up with Monday sucking so much ball gravy? Getting real tired of your shit, Monday. <a href="http://youtu.be/7_rBidCkJxo" target="_blank">Happy late Mother&#8217;s Day to all the baby mamma&#8217;s out there</a>. Hope you had a good day, because it&#8217;s back to your normal bullshit now. So you might still be something when  you&#8217;re dead. I mean, that&#8217;s not confirmed, there&#8217;s some investigation and science that needs to happen, but it might be true. Ellis is going to find out soon enough when he has his heart surgery, then goes to Peru, and then trips on ayahuasca. Aubrey&#8217;s done it, Joe&#8217;s done it, and they&#8217;re smart and still here and functioning. I think this might be the first subject on the show that Dingo hasn&#8217;t pretended to be an expert on, so I think we all might need to trip balls a few more times just so Dingo has to do more psychedelics just to catch up to the rest of the world. Not to be mean of course, just to rub it in, in a friendly manner. He&#8217;s ready to go to Peru and take a mind trip with Ellis, Tully however, is not. Speaking of Dingo, he went to Malibu or some shit this weekend and saw a bunch of famous people like the handsome John C. Reilly. Dingo will also be going to Street League and Ellis will not. Dingo says he would be willing to try and get interviews for the show, which is cool, but Dingo has let Ellis down before so let&#8217;s not get too overly excited just yet. Dingo also has been going to Vegas to be in Lil Jon&#8217;s video or some shit and pouring champagne on motherfuckers and passing out shots. He&#8217;s been doing it for years so he&#8217;s totally unimpressed. OVER IT. He misses his cues, he fucks up and sprays champagne at the wrong time, he falls off the stage sometimes. He don&#8217;t give a shit. He&#8217;s in Lil Jon&#8217;s video, what does he think about it? Big whoop. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://youtu.be/HMUDVMiITOU" target="_blank">link to the &#8220;official&#8221; video</a> that Dingo <em>is not </em>in and here&#8217;s a <a href="http://youtu.be/tIMUXeUAwdE" target="_blank">link to the other video</a> that Dingo <em>is</em> in. (around the 2:28 mark) According to Tully (and The Source &#8220;Dingo&#8221;), Lil Jon is a really nice guy. And that may be true, but this is without a doubt the most I&#8217;ve ever discussed Lil Jon and that makes me feel weird &#8211; so it&#8217;s time to move on.</p>

<p>Is finger banging and old lady like putting eye cream on a set of old wrinkly eye lids? Do animals lick each other&#8217;s genitals? Tully &amp; Dingo say no, Ellis says yes, so then Dingo says yes. As it turns out, bats suck bat dick, or at least the lick bat dick. Tig McPickles is getting into some shit at school, not listening, saying his dad would kick another kid&#8217;s dads ass, etc. <a href="http://instagram.com/papafifty" target="_blank">Papa Fifty</a> is almost dead or likely to die sooner rather than later, he also has his own Instagram now. So UFC was this past weekend and Tully lost his bet, because he put his money on the Brazilian bitch, who of course lost. Looks like he&#8217;ll be spinning the Wheel of Doom. Kenda called in to talk about her titties and how much she desires them to be sucked on &#8211; just kidding &#8211; it was MMA News. Kenda lives in a condo with a community pool, she&#8217;s sitting by the pool now, waiting for someone to come suckle her teets &#8211; just kidding &#8211; she&#8217;s in the bathroom of the community pool taking a dump &#8211; just kidding &#8211; she&#8217;s in there so she can talk while her phone is plugged in to her ass &#8211; just kidding &#8211; it&#8217;s plugged into the wall. She recently had a wet dream about Ellis &#8211; just kidding &#8211; it was a dry dream, but Ellis was in it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7GrGW1ul4U" target="_blank">Michael Sam got drafted into the NFL as the 249th pick by the Rams</a>, if you remember, he&#8217;s the openly gay football player from Missouri. He cried and kissed his boyfriend and as you might have guessed, some people took issue with that.</p>
<div id="attachment_12222" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/coming-with-facts.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12222 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/coming-with-facts.gif" alt="coming-with-facts" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coming in hard with some factual shit.</p></div>
<p>Tully stepped up to spin the Wheel of Doom, he landed on &#8220;Spanked by Will&#8221; and he has to fart, or possibly shit, and piss, so he has no idea how this is going to go. To get things setup, Tully pulls down his pants (underwear on), bends over Will&#8217;s good knee, and gets spanked so he learns his lesson. Learns it <em>real</em> good. Now everyone wants boner inducing spanks from Will. Time for a history game between Ellis and Dingo as hosted by Mike &#8220;My Ass Is Kind of Stingy&#8221; Tully. Who was Machiavelli? He was a drug running in the 1400&#8217;s who invented pizza, rode horses with a saddle, and started the movement of separating Sicilian and Italians. Who was Mussolini? Another Italian, a general, started a revolution when he invented the dumpling during a war with the world for the second time, and was executed for his evil empire against pastries and music. AIDs, it jumped from monkeys to humans because the junky monkeys shared needles, then someone cut a monkey, fuck it, cut it up, sliced them selves because the Slap-Chop™ had not been invented yet, and then under cooked the HIV monkey and BAM! You just got the AIDs. Why did Muhammed Ali refuse to be drafted into the war? He was Muslim and said that&#8217;s bullshit and then served some time for that shit and there ya go. There was a Rocky Marciano movie, what the fuck do you wanna know about him? He used to do shows, people hired him to do stand-up at bars, and he drank a lot, fucked a carrot and that&#8217;s how we got stuck with Carrot Top. Dingo was born, in a world, in 1986. But that&#8217;s also when the Russians got nuclearized by Chernobyl, fish got 3 eyes, bitches got 7 tits, and there was all kinds of fucked up shit, all the Gernobyly people got died unless they escaped to LA to block Ellis&#8217; driveway. Right around the same time, Maria Shriver married Schwarzenegger, created a nice little family, stopped blowing Arnie, she turned bitter, he turned bitter, she fucked herself, he fucked the maid. That or she&#8217;s the freaky one and wanted him to fuck maids, get them pregnant, and call him a pussy while she rubs one out in the corner. William Shakespeare wrote plays, worked for French people and shit, and if it wasn&#8217;t for him there would be no Spielberg. The Red Baron is a dog or a chicken who loves also loves chicken and flies a dog house with wings, he was a Nazi and killed mad people and children, also his pizza is complete shit. Charlie Chaplin was a famous entertainer, his house is now a Russian restaurant run by Australians, he owned more property than anyone else in LA, and was very dark and would do creepy shit to women, he was a real loose unit, and Hitler stole his mustache. Abraham Lincoln was huge, he invented a car, he was a dark human being, he tried to free the blacks with commandments but with more important shit, he wrote a bunch of shit down that said &#8220;this is what&#8217;s up&#8221; and changed the game. Democrats shot him because they knew Obamacare was coming. The Civil War, what was so civil about it anyway? It happened on the east coast, red coats versus blue coats, no motherfuckers thought of wearing camouflage, nobody knew how to step out of the way of shit that can kill you, they were pretty fucked up. We watched Mel Gibson&#8217;s son die because of some cocksuckers, and if it wasn&#8217;t for Colonel Gibson, we&#8217;d all be eating French bread, all over a racist confederate Texas flag while eating blacks, which is crazy because blacks fought each other to see who could get eaten first. Dingo remembers North, South, East, West by reciting a cute little phrase, &#8220;Never Eat Soggy Weetbix&#8221;, so maybe that will help you to remember the four major points on the compass too! And there you have it, hopefully everyone learned something.</p>
<div id="attachment_12229" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fuck-yeah.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12229 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fuck-yeah.gif" alt="fuck-yeah" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ll get off your toilet for a measly $6k.</p></div>
<p>Mr. T won&#8217;t get off the toilet for less than $100k or some shit, so let&#8217;s see what it takes to get some other celebrities off the shitter. Jose Canseco got paid $100k (?) for his last celebrity boxing thing. How much to get Carmen Electra to show up at a party? $100k. How much to get Huge Jackman to show up to your shithole? $250k. How much to get Puffy to show up and shut up? $500k. Pauly Shore? $30k, buuuuddy. Wendy Williams? $10k. Drake? $1M  James Earl Jones? $1M. Chelsea Handler? $100k to show up, $150k to bang her. Cher? $1.5M to show up, $0.75 to eat her out. Mötley Crüe? $150k. Khloé Kardashian? $150k + $100k in food. Slayer? $30k. Avril Lavigne? $350k, no touching. Conversation turned to ayahuasca again and we got calls from listener&#8217;s who knew a guy who knew a guy who saw a guy at a truck stop who told about a guy that knew a sherman who puked and shit himself and talked to dead people who didn&#8217;t drink coffee. It was a real eye opener &#8211; just kidding &#8211; it was fucktarded. We heard about some <a href="http://youtu.be/rjvqc4Dq95k" target="_blank">stupid bitch in Edmonton who attacked a dude on a subway in Edmonton</a>, of course it&#8217;s a fucking world star video. This was a perfect lead into final calls &#8211; sadly nobody dropped a &#8220;world star son, world star, world star, world star&#8221; until they got shot. And that, my friends, wraps this baby up nice and neat like a turd with a bow on it. Enjoy it. Love it. Make out with it. Peel your banana to the left, peel your banana to the right, peel your banana and uh, take a bite! YAY!</p>

<p>Yo, yo, yo! Wazzup my n-bombs? Just kidding, I doubt any of you are Norwegian. That&#8217;d be kinda funny if Norwegians were all thugged out and shooty &amp; stabby, while black people liked cold weather and cross country skiing. Anyway, enough about the stupid things that plague my mind, let&#8217;s see what we had for a show today. We don&#8217;t know fish, because we don&#8217;t get to hang out with them long enough. Even with scuba tanks, it&#8217;s still not long enough to <em>really</em> get to know the fish and the fish to get to know us. Ellis is obviously a massive fan of the supercross, but fuck The Offspring. Remember that whole Faction Board of Directors thing? The results are in, but none of us get to know about any of it &#8211; so I&#8217;m calling bullshit. There&#8217;s no directors. There&#8217;s no board. I&#8217;m not even sure there&#8217;s a Faction. Plus, this website doesn&#8217;t even exist, this isn&#8217;t even a recap either. Ellis saw Thomas Haden Church&#8217;s Castaway movie, called Whitewash. In the movie, he accidentally kills a man during a drunken night joyride, I assume on his snowplow. He hides the body then disappears into the woods. Dingo saw some documentary on mass suicide and it wasn&#8217;t about Jonestown. Is Dingo planning something? I&#8217;m not saying he is, I&#8217;m just sayin you might wanna stay on your toes around him. Will watch a TV show about Fargo or some shit. Tully was the only person on Earth who watch the Mayweather fight. What does Katie call blonde-headed bimbos? Shit pigs. Also, she totally boinked Jared Leto, but don&#8217;t say anything. Apparently she&#8217;s been working lately and Ellis hates it because he misses her. You wanna know what Aussie&#8217;s call a beer? A tinny. Know what a slab is? It&#8217;s a case of beer. Do you really even care? Of course you don&#8217;t. Jetta is looking like shit today, wearing wrinkled clothes, having a &#8220;blah&#8221; attitude, and being high as fuck while on the job. Shout out to Dirty Sean &amp; the boys! Cumtard felt left out so he tried to get all beezy by <a href="http://www.newsnet5.com/news/national/teens-using-lip-balm-on-eyelids-to-enhance-being-drunk-high" target="_blank">trying out the latest trend among the kids, beezin&#8217;</a>. Beezin&#8217; didn&#8217;t work and Cumtard did not end up pooping in the hat the doctor gave him, even though he&#8217;s had diarrhea again this morning. He also failed at using his boner as a towel rack. The dude that played Deebo in the movie Friday drives a Bentley and you know Dingo can vouch for that shit because Dingo knows everyone. Drugs and shark tattoos of a shark eating a man were two other short topics, not at the same time though.</p>
<div id="attachment_12167" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buy-that-for-a-dollar.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12167 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buy-that-for-a-dollar.gif" alt="buy-that-for-a-dollar" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That pinky ring from Kelly?</p></div>
<p>You got any suggestions for the wheel of doom? Tweet those ideas to the show. Ellis was looking for electronic drum kits, Devin already found a little rhythm and Tiger just goes apeshit like Animal from The Muppets. Tully got checked by TJ Lavin for one of his comments during the show last week. Dingo got gifted a little pinky ring from noted shit pig, Kelly Osbourne. I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; they&#8217;re fucking, I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217; ewww. Dingo tells us that the delay in Kanye &amp; Ditch Pig&#8217;s wedding is because they&#8217;re hammering out a prenupt, because he makes a lot of money but also spends a lot of money. Segue into <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/u-s-world/bakersfield-police-teen-accused-of-passing-out-semen-filled-cupcakes-at-school-050214" target="_blank">Bakerfield police investigated cummy pubic hair cupcakes</a> some chick made for all the bullies at her school. Jude&#8217;s currently looking at <a href="http://instagram.com/p/noRKZavj35/" target="_blank">Cumtard&#8217;s porn girlfriend&#8217;s snatch</a> in his studio, which isn&#8217;t really breaking news for Jude, Cumtard, or that porn chick&#8217;s snatch. By the way, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/noPb8FPj1n/" target="_blank">Cumtard is okay with all this</a>. Ellis is trying to be nicer to callers because of this supposed Board of Directors thing saying people want him to be nicer. Today&#8217;s Cinco de Mayo, celebrating tequila, tacos, and cheap labor. A caller swears there is a penis fertility test for Cumtard to take to help cure his lazy boner. First he has to do some marathon masturbation in a 16-hour span and then pull his nuts out as far as he can or something. I can&#8217;t see how scientific this could be, but I&#8217;m backing the idea for Cumtard to do because his dick is gonna be ground up hamburger after 16 hours of whackin&#8217; it.</p>
<div id="attachment_12176" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/whatd-you-do.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12176 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/whatd-you-do.gif" alt="whatd-you-do" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Travis when someone gets hurt at Pastranaland.</p></div>
<p>One of Dingo&#8217;s friends came in for a visit, Trevor Jacob. He&#8217;s a snowboarder, Olympian, in Nitro Circus, and probably has more accolades that I&#8217;m not mentioning. He actually met Ellis when he was 6-years-old and Ellis had broken a world record. He went up to Ellis to get an autograph but didn&#8217;t have anything for him to sign, so Ellis took off one of the DC shoes he was currently wearing, signed the shoe, and gave it to Trevor. The two reminisced about the past, talked about how they&#8217;re both pretty crazy, making dumb decisions, taking some bad spills, and also talked a little about what he&#8217;s doing now and plans for the future. They watched a <a href="http://youtu.be/tZR9zxob3Qo" target="_blank">video of Trevor almost dying at Pastranaland</a> and a <a href="http://youtu.be/964D3h3vWyI" target="_blank">video of him doing the first double backflip on a skateboard</a>. Dude had to have anal surgery for a broken tailbone too. That&#8217;s surgery going through the butthole. A widened butthole. With tools and shit. So many innuendos, too little time. <a href="http://youtu.be/eh_HUIJkRzU" target="_blank">Ever seen a goblin shark?</a> Well now you have. You act like your parents because of you choice of pants. Wait, no. You act like your parents because of your <del>genes</del> jeans. And that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re a bitch-ass ass-bitch, because you look like your mother wearing mom jeans that go above your belly button and you got that bitch pouch mid-zipper. OH!</p>

<p>Sexual degenerate Jason Ellis is live! But let&#8217;s not fuck around here, we got some serious news to get into. <a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/mlg-and-espn-team-up-for-esports-event-at-x-games-austin/" target="_blank">MLG and ESPN have teamed up for the first-ever e-sports event at X-Games in Austin, Texas</a>. That&#8217;s right, the world of action sports has been so diluted now that button pushing video gamers will now have a chance to win an X-TREME BRONZE, or a REALLY X-TREME SILVER, or the all mighty REALLY SUPER DOUBLE X-TREME GOLD medal in the X-Games. Ah yes, people will remember where they were at when Jimmy Pisspants pulled off the first ever &#8220;trash talk you mom, B, A, B, A&#8221; button combo! Remember that one time that video game character died and got tea bagged by another video game character? Riveting. Ellis is heated about this and refuses to go to X-Games. Dingo, being the savvy investor he is, understands the bold move but also thinks it&#8217;s pretty funny. Tully agrees that fine, people can be into video games and watch other people play video games, but the combination doesn&#8217;t belong or work together. This topic took up the entire first hour of the show, which is understandable due to the nature of the channel, the show, and Ellis &amp; company.</p>
<div id="attachment_12117" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kenda-is-calling.gif" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-12117 size-full" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kenda-is-calling.gif" alt="kenda-is-calling" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dingo&#8217;s reaction to Kenda calling in.</p></div>
<p>Before the show could go into break, Kenda Perez called in with this past weekends UFC bouts in Baltimore. Overall, the fights were pretty good. Two quick side notes here. 1. Ellis had a dream about Rhonda Rousey where she wouldn&#8217;t let him train at her gym but held his hand while she told him this, so that&#8217;s sweet. And 2. Dingo needs a potty break, but toughed it out since Kenda was on the phone. Anyway, Jones once again defended his title, this time against Glover Teixeira. Phil Davis lost his fight against Anthony Johnson. Some dude with gauges in his earlobes fought with his gross jump rope earlobes taped up so a finger or toe wouldn&#8217;t accidentally get caught in there rip that shit. Oh, and this 5&#8242; 11&#8243; chick fighter dressed in all green looked kinda like a female Jolly Green Giant &#8211; also, she lost her fight. Anyway, I&#8217;m not reporting all that, you can go online to read what all happened if you haven&#8217;t already seen it. And that lead us into the first break where Dingo could go potty.</p>

<p>Moto news time. Villopoto won and seemed like he hated it and he&#8217;s still on top of the overall standings. Eli Tomac took 2nd, and Josh Hill took 3rd. James Stewart withdrew from the race with an apparent injury to his left leg, allegedly. That pretty much wraps up the season, even though there is still 1 more race to go. Hey, did you <a href="http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dad-caught-tape-kicking-son-down-skateboard-ramp-031840487--abc-news-topstories.html" target="_blank">see that piece of shit dad who was caught on tope kicking his 6-year-old son down a skateboard ramp</a>? Pretty fucked up. We got to hear some HateBean tracks today. We also got to ask how everyone is doing today and thankfully everyone seems to be doing very well, except for Hardcore &amp; Cumtard &#8211; he&#8217;s a little cranky today. Ellis tried to whip him back into a good mood, but Cumtard feels like he received mixed messages during the motivational talk. I don&#8217;t know how the message could be mixed. I mean, &#8220;Tell yourself you&#8217;re worth a fucking shit, you stupid bag of retarded cum.&#8221; seems pretty clear to me. HEYOH! Anyway, the guys all spent about 30 minutes giving advice and pep talks to Cumtard and his mental &amp; physical health. So why is Hardcore all cranky? He&#8217;s got girl problems son. He doesn&#8217;t really want to discuss it, but he did admit that he slept on the couch last night and when he woke up this morning, they didn&#8217;t say a word to each other and he just went to work. As we all know, that means you&#8217;re wrong &#8211; even if you&#8217;re right &#8211; you&#8217;re still wrong. He&#8217;s gonna have to bite the bullet on this one and stop being stubborn. And this took us into our second break for the day. Hour and half segments today, there&#8217;s just TOO MUCH SHOW!</p>

<p>And we&#8217;re back! Next week the show is going to do a &#8220;worst music on YouTube&#8221; segment that you can help with by sending in links to said horrible music to the show. That does not include the video I sent into the show called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJEoUz_ntw" target="_blank">&#8220;Shit Don Frye Says&#8221;</a>. Turns out Don&#8217;s a little creepy, but he&#8217;s also pretty funny. And insane. And tough as hell. And he don&#8217;t give two shits who the fuck you are, he&#8217;ll talk shit on ya. So the owner of the <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/26/donald-sterling-clippers-owner-black-people-racist-audio-magic-johnson/" target="_blank">LA Clippers, Donald Sterling, has been caught on tape with a racist rant</a>. Supposedly only 15 minutes of the audio was leaked, but there is over an hour&#8217;s worth of this audio, allegedly of course. What makes it really odd, I mean, besides his clear racism, is that his girlfriend is half black and half Mexican. Also, gross. He&#8217;s got old balls. I missed a few minutes after that because I&#8217;m sought after fellow for my sage-like advice and wisdom. HA! When I came back, there was talk about acid and some dude getting some harsh jail time. This led us into talk about brain steroids, aka Adderall, and how them pesky college kids are doing that shit up. And this in turn brought about a story of Ellis getting a massage in Thailand from this lady who smoked some meth before getting to work on the massage. Apparently Dog The Bounty Hunter hasn&#8217;t been to Thailand because the ice is flowin&#8217;, son! Oh yeah, and there&#8217;s some discussion going on with Ellis&#8217; manager and the possibility of EllisMania 10 and possibly SpikeTV! Dingo surprised the show with gifts and it&#8217;s not even Christmas, he gave everyone some Beats by Dre headphones. We left off with some final calls, where a lady-boy from Taiwan was happy to be able to smoke crack with Mr. Jason Erris and say how much they miss him. So there ya have it, a nutshell. So to speak. And now it&#8217;s time I bid you farewell, until we meet again. If you catch my drift. BONER JAMS 2014!</p>
