			<p>Ahem&#8230;ahem&#8230;let me preface this by apologizing for the lack of links&#8230;my puppy chewed apart my laptop charger and I am posting this from an iPad and anytime I click the hyperlink button it erases a paragraph of what I just wrote&#8230;so&#8230;no.</p>
<p>Secondly, Dan, you may or may not be the alleged creator of the don&#8217;t die show recap and the lone speaker for all those who have real jobs and can&#8217;t sit around taking notes (I personally wish that I thought as highly of myself as you do, by the way), but No You Are perfected the art of TJES recap, and this is how it&#8217;s done:</p>
<p>Ellis is &#8220;that dude&#8221; and it&#8217;s been a long ass time since he took a good look at the hole (haha&#8230;see what I did there?) but he&#8217;s pretty secure about it. He&#8217;s also pretty secure about how fat he is right now, but Mike Dolce is going to be on the show today and will probably turn that right around. Coincidence? I think not! There&#8217;s always emotions when a penis goes into a vagina, no matter what level of cold-hearted bitch status you have achieved in life, and that&#8217;s why it may be difficult for girls to have strictly sexual, no-feeling relationships with guys. Ellis says he believes that it can work for girls for a certain stretch of time in their lives, but for it to be on-going&#8230;he&#8217;ll go right ahead and call bullshit on that one. Men can have a hard time battling emotions when it comes to having sex with a girl, especially a really hot girl, and yeah, that&#8217;s a little girly&#8230;but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a little bit girly in different aspects of your life. Consequently&#8230;.there&#8217;s definitely room for some girliness in life when you&#8217;re awesome enough for RCH racing to give you a motorbike, which will be delivered to your workplace so that you may perform burn-outs, get carbon monoxide poisoning and cause damage to your surroundings much to the chagrin of your boss. Breaking Shit My Pants MMA News is next on the agenda at the good ol&#8217; Jason Ellis Show because there were fights on last night brought to you by the wonderful folks over at FoxSports1. Tully mentions that the Venezuelen Vixen, who won the Ultimate Fighter this past season, was in the crowd and was looking beautiful. She was also aware of her beauty and when the camera panned on her she took the opportunity to flip her hair over her shoulder and reveal her decidedly non-cauliflower ears. Cause Venezuelan bitches have great fucking ears. Onto the actual fight part of MMA News, Ellis wanted to talk about something that everyone should be talking about, but no one was- the fact (because we&#8217;re just gonna take this one as fact) that Yoel Romero- an Olympic Silver Medalist Wrestler turned MMA fighter- shit his teeny purple lycra pants and won his fight against Derek Brunson. And really&#8230;there is no denying that he shit his pants. Tully, a self-touting &#8216;you shit yourself&#8217; expert who is two years deep in shit experience to the date, agrees with Ellis that there is no other explanation other than Romero rocket sharted during the fight. Romero allegedy denied that he defecated in his shorts, but everyone who was in attendance, everyone in the locker room, and basically everyone online agrees that no, it was not water and sweat, it was stinky poopie schmear. Why is no one really talking about it? Probably has something to do with the fact that this guy, who is a walking specimen of what fitness and muscle should look like is&#8230;well&#8230;a walking specimen of what fitness and muscle should look like and is fully capable of beating the shit out of you so that you too could know what it felt like to fight with poopie pants. Some calls were taken on the subject, a scientific justification was given for pants shitting during fighting using the parasympathetic nervous system fight or flight response, and everyone agrees that he made a poopie. Ellis isn&#8217;t really trying to rag too hard on the guy, because hey, shit happens.</p>
<p>Ellis, Tully,and Cumtard are heading to Vegas after the show tonight (and are probably already there by the time that I am typing this) in order to attend the AVN&#8217;s and hang out with porn stars. Tully feels slightly bad about this as today is Little Dude&#8217;s second birthday and Daddy will be spending it in Vegas at a porn convention. But hey, chances are Little Dude will have absolutely no memory of this so&#8230;Party On Tully! After Ellis gets back from Vegas he is gonna hang with his kiddies and hopefully do some fun things, so long as his kids are feeling better. Because they are sick. They were apparently up on and off throughout the night last night and Daddy Ellis was doing his best to take care of them and be the good daddy that he is. Their mummy wanted them to go to school this morning, but after being up all night with them Daddy Ellis made the big N-O call on that one, but when he tried to call Mummy to pick them up so he could go to work, he wasn&#8217;t able to get in touch with her. He called and texted and called and texted and was starting to think that he would have to call Tully and tell him that they would be doing an extremely PG rated show in a box full of germs when Mummy finally called him back. Why wasn&#8217;t she answering her phone? Because she was also sick and had slept in past 10 AM. Ellis can&#8217;t even imagine sleeping until 10 in the morning because he is 42. I can&#8217;t imagine sleeping past 10 AM because I have a 4 year old who will tell you that it&#8217;s morning and time to wake up if he wakes up at 3 AM. Fucking kids. Good thing they&#8217;re cute.</p>
<p>Someone from Mattel, who Will isn&#8217;t sure if they can share the name, sent a package to Tully and Ellis bursting with toys for the kiddos, which was awesome and made them both really awesome daddies in the eyes of their offspring. Tully used the toys to dissuade Little Man from going outside when it was cold (read: cold in LA means that it was probably a balmy 65 degrees out), and Daddy Ellis had it all in his car to keep the kids busy on the ride from Mummy to Daddy&#8217;s house. Win. Will comments that the people who listen to the show (or you know, read about the show on really awesome websites run by some really awesome people) who never hesitate to spend time, effort, and money to send things to everyone at TJES, and really are a tight knit group who help each other out and genuinely care for one another. Ellisfam is amazing. Case closed.</p>
<p>Ellis wants to freeze his blood in Red Dragons ice cube trays and put them in Katie&#8217;s drinks because that is so twistedly romantic. I&#8217;m a girl. I get it. *Heart eyes* Will has a gigantic problem with the thought of this and suggests that instead, Ellis makes a paperweight out of his blood, because it will last longer. No. No, Wilson. No. He wants to be inside his hot chick without having to be inside his hot chick. And it would take a really awesome picture. Tully suggests that Ellis make a blood snow globe instead, but Ellis would have to dilute the water to see whatever is inside and that is lame as hell. Tully wants to know how Ellis plans on getting a good quantity of blood out of himself in order to make the blood-cubes and it seems like Ellis just wants to shove a hypodermic into his veins and suck it out. Like a man. And no, Will, he won&#8217;t be shooting bubbles of air into his veins so that he dies of an air embolism. smh. Will comments that the Red Cross won&#8217;t take blood from gay people and thinks it&#8217;s kind of weird, but they&#8217;ve always been that way, and Tully kind of backs that decision. It&#8217;s probably not because the Red Cross hates gay people, and has more to do with the fact that homosexuals, unfortunately, run a statistically higher risk of contracting some very unkind diseases that people don&#8217;t want in their donated blood (or at least those were the statistics at the time the Red Cross made this policy, I&#8217;m not really sure if they have changed). For the record, the Red Cross won&#8217;t take blood from a lot of different kinds of people- people who recently traveled out of the country, people who have been pierced or tattooed within the past year, and people who smell funny. I may have made that last one up.</p>
<p>Tully received his Faction Board of Directors survey in his email this morning, and like a good listener (who doesn&#8217;t listen), he filled it out and pressed the send button. Will informs him that the survey he received this morning is just a phase one survey and that there will be a more in depth one to come, which will also include questions about TJES. Apparently Will thinks there are some things about the show that should change (which he won&#8217;t tell us on air because he does not want to taint our weak minds) and he thinks that there are some things that we listeners may want to change as well, feedback is a good thing, yadda yadda. I&#8217;m really not going to go into the ensuing conversation because it was a re-hashing of something I re-capped either last week or the week before (not entirely sure&#8230;I just know I was sitting outside the house of someone&#8217;s whose pipes had burst that we were trying to fix and waiting for backup from a frenchman while I was listening to it) and if you wanna know what Ellis, Tully, and Will&#8217;s stances are on the whole Faction Board of Directors/what&#8217;s being played on Faction issue you can go read that. You&#8217;re welcome. Thank you.</p>
<p>Back from the first break Kenda Perez is on the phone waiting to talk some more MMA news. Ellis thinks that Kenda is awesome because she is super hot and she laughs at his joke, and a man feels good when a hot lady laughs at his jokes. She was watching the fights in Georgia last night in person, like someone dedicated to their job would do, and she didn&#8217;t notice that Romero had pooped his pants while she was watching the fight, but her BFF texted her about it real-time, and she said that everyone in the crowd knew about it and was talking about it. Apparently, the locker room was not smelling so nice following the fight, someone thought that someone had vomitted, and yeah&#8230;he&#8217;s not getting away from the fact that he shit his pants. They talked some more about the fights, and every fought good, and I have a really hard time paying attention to MMA news because I enjoy MMA but I don&#8217;t know anyone&#8217;s name, I just know they punch each other in the face and bleed a lot. Romero punched his opponent in the dick and was all &#8216;hahaha&#8217; about it, and Kenda thinks that he punched Bronson because he shit himself&#8230;which makes sense to no one but the lovely Kenda herself. Tully summed up an MMA match quite well astonishing both Ellis and Kenda who talked about taking a break and getting a drink and letting Tully keep on talking about MMA news since he did such a good job and I don&#8217;t know what he said cause Hubbs&#8217; started talking to me about something. I don&#8217;t remember what Hubbs said at this point either, if that makes you feel any better. Before Kenda gets off the phone she mentions that she is back home in Newport Beach (thank God because it was cold as fuck in Georgia) and is in her bikini bottoms and a Nirvana tank top because she is going to hang up and then go sit by the pool. She asks Ellis for some shirts so she can make them look sexy and represent poolside. I made a joke to Hubbs that she was just going to sit by the pool because she&#8217;s a girl and God forbid she actually goes in the water and messes up her hair, or makeup, or whatever&#8230;and I can say that because I am a girl.</p>
<p>Ellis has changed his mind about poetry being lame because poetry is an art form (however douchey it may be) and it takes passion&#8230;.so all of you poets out there are now in the clear so far as Ellis is concerned. This somehow morphs into Tully and Ellis discussing which sports are actually sports and which sports are games, or skills, or activities, or what have you. Tully&#8217;s rule of thumb for sport classification is that sports need to have sustained cardio to be considered real sports. Baseball doesn&#8217;t make the cut for him, but Ellis disagrees. Football is a sport- along with running, swimming, MMA, Sumo Wrestling, and porn. Will asks whether spear-chucking is a sport (aka the Javelin Throw) and Ellis and Tully call him out for his racist comment. Will splutters that he wasn&#8217;t being racist and that he is very sensitive to racist comments&#8230;when he isn&#8217;t spewing them. Hubbs had to explain to me why &#8216;spear-chucking&#8217; is a racist comment to say&#8230;and I say that, because of that, I am the least racist person in this room right now. So&#8230;I beat the puppy&#8230;because Joe is in the shower. Ping Pong may or may not be a sport, paintball is definitely not a sport, and everybody knows that curling is not. a. fucking. sport. Duh.</p>
<p>Tully tells us that somewhere in Arizona a mother was walking around with her toddler when her toddler toddled across the cover for a septic tank which then buckled under the extreme weight of said toddler, and the baby fell in to poopie soup. While the mommy was standing there screaming &#8220;My baby! My baby!&#8221; A good samaritan didn&#8217;t stop to think before shedding his shoes and jumping in after the toddler. The man successfully rescued the fallen toddler with the help of a couple other good sams. who showed up, and the blue faced baby who had been under for several minutes was successfully resuscitated at the seen by one of the helpful passers-by who didn&#8217;t just pass by. The initial good samaritan had been released from prison only two weeks earlier and has definitely made a good start on his journey to turn his life around. It&#8217;s always good to save a baby.</p>
<p>Mike Dolce is in the studio today to talk to Ellis about ways to be less fat :D and he is Mega in the UFC game. He is the one that all the winners turn to when they want to be winners and cut weight- the right way. Mike Dolce- developer of the Dolce Diet (go figure)- tells Ellis that instead of eating fistfuls of candy at night he should eat some frozen red grapes to satisfy his late night sugar cravings. And why does Ellis crave sugar so hard at night? Because sugar is fuel and is brain fuel and after a long day of talking on the radio and not eating so good in the middle of the day, he needs to satisfy his brain&#8217;s need for fuel. Boom. Now Ellis has a good alternative to crunching malted milk balls that won&#8217;t wake Katie up in the middle of the night. Dolce next tackles Tully&#8217;s lunch and gives him a hi five for his salmon, but says that it&#8217;s all down hill from there since he is eating it with bleached flour pasta. Tully only eats white pasta because that&#8217;s what Italians eat and there sure as hell isn&#8217;t wheat pasta being home made by people in Italy. And Diet Coke is poison. There are four books by Mike Dolce on fitness and dieting, and if you want to get into a good exercise routine you should visit UFCFit.com and get the workout DVDs which are great for people who have been living the sedentary lifestyle for 6 months to 2 years. Dolce says that the key to being more healthy is to hold yourself accountable, to set reasonable goals, eat based on your hunger and activity levels, eat to feel satisfied- not &#8216;full&#8217;, and to plan on being 1% better today than you were yesterday. When asked by Tully what food choices may have made Romero shit his pants during a fight Dolce replies, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, it wasn&#8217;t me!&#8221; Which made me laugh for a solid five minutes.</p>
<p>Back from the break Tully informs us that the man who was a victim of anal probing thanks to police has reached a financial settlement of 1.6 million dollars. Ellis thinks that the police who subjected him to this anal horror should be anal raped for two straight days in penance, but we all know that isn&#8217;t going to happen. Tully states that no one has ever been able to sufficiently explain to him why the old &#8216;eye for an eye&#8217; policy just won&#8217;t work. I think Ghandi had some words about Hammurabi&#8217;s Famous Code, although I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really the best explanation either. Ellis hopes that the man doesn&#8217;t have to pay taxes on his settlement, and Tully asks that if someone well versed in law, like a lawyer, is listening if they can call the show and let everyone know about that. A lawyer does not call&#8230;or maybe one does and can&#8217;t get through because no one is answering the phones. Will says that it&#8217;s his fault, but Ellis and Tully give him shit for it because the phones were being answered more often when there was one intern and now there are two producers. Ellis and Tully want to have a superbike race and Will thinks that&#8217;s a bad idea and that he is &#8216;that creepy guy&#8217; at the mall. But he probably isn&#8217;t. Tully breaks the news that the Philly police have arrested the Swiss Cheese Masturbator, and let&#8217;s us know that this isn&#8217;t the first time that he has been arrested for dairy related sex crimes. Apparently in 2009 he was arrested for propositioning a woman on the street with 20 bucks to rub a brick of cheese on his Johnson. As the show winds down they talk about going to Vegas and the AVN&#8217;s, take calls from final callers who still don&#8217;t understand how phones work, and try to persuade Will to accompany them to Vegas.</p>

<p>Welcome back, our only friend! First recap of 2014 is about to be all up inside of you. All. Up. Inside. Up in &#8216;dem guts, naw I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;? So here we are, inside the hole radio. Ellis&#8217; eyes have been opened, he now knows Canada is all Asian, even the white people. Ellis also went to see some moto this past Saturday, he didn&#8217;t like the common people seats (nose bleed seats), but he hung in there. Dingo pretended to see some moto this past Saturday, from his sofa &#8211; but that don&#8217;t stop the Dingo from bringing in some moto gossip. Apparently Twitch had a video on his Instagram of Alessi crying, but now that&#8217;s been reported and removed for some reason. Ellis missed that, the GOAT doing hot laps, fireworks, etc. while he was meeting Grant Cobb in the parking lot to get him in to the common people seats. Speaking of Grant, Ellis finally finished up his head tattoo last night. And speaking of Ellis, he will be on Dr. Drew&#8217;s TV show tonight. Speaking of Dr. Drew, it&#8217;s tickle time because Broc Tickle got 8th or some shit. Lumpy Ellis has officially moved on to greener pastures, he was removed from his host face two weeks ago before the trip to Canada &#8211; hence no third seat needed on the plane. Speaking of money, Dingo feels like this is his year, he&#8217;s gonna be rolling in the dough and hanging out with more famous people. Speaking of dough, Wilson is thinking about starting to self-medicate for diabetes. Speaking of diabetes, you can join the <a href="http://www.siriusxmsurvey.com/ot/reg/sirius_28" target="_blank">Faction Board of Directors</a> to help change what music is played on the channel.</p>

<p>Kenda Perez called into the show to talk about New Year&#8217;s and MMA. Antonio &#8220;Bigfoot&#8221; Silva failed his post fight drug test and got stripped of his $50k bonus, which I assume was going to be put to good use for a specially modified pillow for that massive Omnimax dome of his. Anderson &#8220;The Spider&#8221; Silva (The Spider and Bigfoot are not related) snapped his leg like it was a #2 pencil in the crack of a stripper&#8217;s ass. It looked like it didn&#8217;t tickle. Like, at all. Ronda &#8220;Rowdy&#8221; Rousey won her fight with Miesha &#8220;Cupcake&#8221; Tate and riled a bunch of people up after refusing to shake hands with her opponent. Tito &#8220;Ouch, My Neck&#8221; Ortiz crashed his Porsche today and was arrested on suspicion of DUI. Breaking MMA news, Dominick Cruz has pulled out of his fight with Renan Barao due to a groin injury and will give up his title &#8211; and now Urijah Faber will be fighting Barao. Guess where Dingo&#8217;s never been, Africa &#8211; but he&#8217;s been to Spain, and he still knows more about Africa than you. But that&#8217;s neither here nor there, we&#8217;re talking about South African CPR. Apparently they have some kind of <a href="http://youtu.be/cFlUOVJyV4I" target="_blank">indigenous fight club and when a dude got knocked out, they splashed water on his face &#8211; oh, and jerked him off</a>. Know what else Dingo has seen? Shaun White&#8217;s erect pecker, because, you know, kids and stuff. He say&#8217;s Shaun&#8217;s packing a big ole ginger dick. So, perfect segue time, the Ellis kids got some crazy carts for Christmas and anytime Tiger gets passed by his sister, he gets possessed and drives straight into rage world. He started ramming the shit out of sissy, spinning out, and crashing into everything.</p>
<div id="attachment_6458" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/man_this_is_bullshit.gif" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-6458 " alt="man_this_is_bullshit" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/man_this_is_bullshit.gif" width="400" height="175" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/man_this_is_bullshit.gif 400w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/man_this_is_bullshit-300x131.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">NOBODY PASSES EL TIGRE!</p></div>
<p>Fuck snakes on a plane, and fuck dogs on a plane. And fuck dogs in restaurants. That&#8217;s Wilson and Tully&#8217;s position on the matter, unless of course you&#8217;re a god damned, bat shit crazy asshole &#8211; then you may be excused depending on how mentally disturbed you really are. Speaking of offensive, while flying back from their holidays, Tully&#8217;s son vurped (vomit burp) right into Tully&#8217;s crotch while on the plane. He tried to clean himself up as much as possible, but ended up having to sit in with his barf moistened balls, stinking like rotten milk barf. Then they land in Denver, the plane&#8217;s delayed, so he&#8217;s still just chilling with vomit balls, get&#8217;s on the next plane and has to sit next to a stranger. Talk about an awkward flight, how do you even begin to explain throw-up sack? Awful. Just awful. Hey, <a href="http://youtu.be/_ePx61TkXKY" target="_blank">Piers Morgan accepted a challenge to receive 6 cricket pitches from Brett Lee</a> and earned himself a cracked rib for his troubles. I don&#8217;t care about Piers, cricket, or some dude named Brett Lee &#8211; but I do support anyone beaning Piers by throwing balls at him.</p>
<div id="attachment_6460" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canadian_customs.gif" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-6460 " alt="canadian_customs" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canadian_customs.gif" width="544" height="306" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canadian_customs.gif 544w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canadian_customs-300x168.gif 300w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canadian_customs-500x281.gif 500w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canadian customs or football coach?</p></div>
<p>So on the way to Vancouver, Canadian Customs called Ellis off to the side and asked him if he was mad dogging one of the customs agents. Dingo thinks the head tattoo is to blame. For all the talk about how nice Canadians are, their customs agents really would make you think differently, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever run into one that wasn&#8217;t power tripping on something or another. While Tully was in Wisconsin, he ran into the ass patched jeans and gathered some evidence to help prove his point to Ellis that True Religion / Affliction style jeans are still alive and kicking. So while pushing a stroller through the mall with his is mother-in-law, he tried to snap a few pictures of Milwaukee locals&#8217; asses without being busted by people or mall cops for it. Dedication and hard work, kids, that&#8217;s what gets the job done. There&#8217;s a <a href="www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u75hh/i_am_the_guy_with_two_penises_ama/?limit=500" target="_blank">dude with 2 cocks who did a Q &amp; A</a> on reddit.com. I&#8217;m not really sure what else to say about that other than, &#8220;huh.&#8221; Speaking of dicks, it took 15 cops to get some dude wigged out on meth to stop masturbating, remember the talk about dedication and hard work, kids? Speaking of tards, sounds like it is official, the newest member of TJES is Cumtard, as a producer. Welcome back you pube eating / smoking / bro-cone / baby bird / champion! And there you have it, the first TJES recap of 2014. I mean, a real recap, not a phoned in, 30 second, hodgepodge of words. OH!<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px;">(Disclaimer: That&#8217;s a joke. That&#8217;s what we do. Make jokes.)</span></p>

I&#8217;m not drunk, really.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s that time again kiddies! No, not time for booger art, it&#8217;s time for Monday&#8217;s re-cap! No Dingo today, he&#8217;s caught a case of the cunties and is sick. Ellis was thinking if he was tiger faced man, more man than tiger &#8211; think like Tony the Tiger, he would have to save the world by fighting crime with a bulletproof vest. His kids would find it weird at first, but after they got used to it, maybe while having a bowl of Frosted Flakes, they&#8217;d be cool with it. Is it worth it? So Ellis could still have cancer because Dr. Creepy didn&#8217;t cut that lump off his face yet. And now his jaw is hurting. Tully is not on board the Ellis has cancer train, he thinks it&#8217;s all in his mind. Ellis did a lot of shit over the weekend, more horse riding on the tard trail on his big-ass horse. Apparently a lot of the old western movies were shot in Burbank, but Cheers was not, or maybe it was. Probably not though. Ellis also jumped his motozuki this weekend, so mark that one off the bucket list. It&#8217;s great to hear that his face lump isn&#8217;t slowing him down and he keep crossing things off his bucket list, you know, just in case he dies during his lumpectomy. Just kidding Ellis, you&#8217;re not going to die anymore than I&#8217;m going to be hilariously funny in this recap. Jude stopped in for few minutes and talked about how his podcast pal is a lyric snob and basically thought Jude&#8217;s rap on the Death! Death! Die! album was child-like. Wilson has a boo-boo on his arm and so he&#8217;s wearing a bandage to hide the cancer-stricken hideousness that is festering there.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even remember how, but somehow we got on the 9/11 conspiracy theory topic. Oh, wait, I remember now. It was Sluggo. Kenda called in to talk about the UFC fights that happened over the weekend and to say she hopes she&#8217;s never been put on the &#8220;ho phone&#8221;. You know, like one of the three Wilson carries around on him at all times. There were some good fights and they were all free, so that was cool. If you missed them, you should check out the reruns that are already playing. Or read about them on the Internet at www dot pee pee hole dot com dot au dot org. Anyway, you know how Kenda is always around the MMA events and dudes wanna take pictures with her? Get this, when some dudes go to put their arm around her for the photo, her shoulder goes right into their sweaty armpits. Think about next time you&#8217;re kissing on a chicks shoulder. It probably tastes like Right Guard and that&#8217;s why. Michael Buffer is out for Bruce&#8217;s (his brother) throat, to be America&#8217;s Next Top Ring Announcer. But according to a caller, Bruce practices in the nude, so that might make him indestructible. I like to pretend that when they&#8217;re mad at each other, they both use their announcing voice to insult one another. &#8220;Ladies and gentleman, turn your attention to the asshole in the kitchen, my fucking bitch of a brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellis and Wilson like watching their local news, mainly because Sam Rubin is on. Tully hates it because the pace and flow suck, not to mention the people reading the news are fucking clowns. Not literally penetrating or being penetrated by clowns, but acting like clowns. Actually, I take that back. They&#8217;re doing all of it. A Wichita news anchor accidentally let the viewership know that <a href="http://deadspin.com/wichita-news-anchor-is-ready-to-get-the-fuck-out-of-he-1483669323?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow" target="_blank">he was ready to get the fuck out of work</a>. Who is that crazy-ass white boy with tattoos that isn&#8217;t Ellis? Who knows. Dude, is it gay if <a href="http://instagram.com/p/h8mL5Fg071/" target="_blank">Ronnie Faisst put Twitch&#8217;s toothbrush on his dick</a>, then Twitch brushed his teeth with it? Twitch responded by putting Ronnie&#8217;s toothbrush in his ass and then Ronnie brushed his teeth with it? It&#8217;s full of homoerotic overtones, but it&#8217;s more stupid than it is gay. Hey, are you into conspiracy theories? Like on a pack of Marlboro&#8217;s there&#8217;s &#8220;KKK&#8221; and &#8220;Horrible Jew&#8221; type shit? Then you&#8217;re most likely batshit crazy, but that doesn&#8217;t make any of that bullshit any less fun at times. Like rocks are actually soft and squishy, they just tense up when we touch them or that Lady Gaga is actually JonBenét Ramsey. Let those sink in and blow your mind! We got to hear from a lot of crazies, but the fun has to end at some point and more serious business matters need to be addresses, like handing out Wolfknives names.</p>
<p>Now that we blew your mind with conspiracy theories, let&#8217;s talk about another kind of blowing &#8211; glory holes. They are out there. Apparently it&#8217;s more common than most of us would tend to think. You ever go to the mall? Yup. Glory holes. You ever go to an adult bookstore? Of course, glory holes. Airports? Indeed. Glory holes. Rest stops? Oh hell yeah. Glory holes. Basically, you&#8217;ve probably been in close proximity of a glory hole. And let&#8217;s face it, that means you&#8217;ve made eye contact with many a man who loves to gargle the load of another man &#8211; because girls aren&#8217;t in men&#8217;s bathrooms. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, but it sure is an eye opener. I missed a few minutes of the show (looking to see if there&#8217;s a glory hole in my house) and when I came back, Will was talking about how it&#8217;s unconstitutional to keep the phone records of Americans. I have no idea how we got here, but here we are none the less. Talk turned to how peoples&#8217; webcams and such have been hacked so others can watch / spy on you unbeknownst to you. That shit definitely happens along with many other scarier things, so keep that shit in mind next time your sitting in front of your webcam eating your boogers. Why did nobody come to Billy&#8217;s birthday party? Because the clown he hired for the entertainment had opened fire on a crowd of tourists in New York the previous week, before killing himself, which soured the whole occasion. OH!</p>

<p>Yo. I&#8217;m bitPimps and this is how post a fuckin&#8217; re-cap. Why the fuck is every other fuckin&#8217; word outta my fuckin&#8217; mouth a fuckin&#8217; fuck word? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcVxp6kTIeI" target="_blank">Because I&#8217;m fuckin&#8217; learning how to be a fuckin&#8217; man from this fuckin&#8217; guy.</a> But fuckin&#8217; seriously. Welcome to fuckin&#8217; Monday&#8217;s show. STOP IT! Sorry. My man training is becoming a bit of a habit. Ellis has been humbled. Sometimes he thinks he&#8217;s not scared of stuff and that we&#8217;re all a bunch of pussies. But he likes stretching, vitamins, and not getting hurt and having to go to the hospital &#8211; it scares him a little. Friday he ate some pastries, Saturday he ate more pastries and went to ride moto with some dudes (and moto dudes are gnarly), and Sunday was pay the price day. He couldn&#8217;t jump anything because he was afraid he was gonna eat shit, so this made him feel shitty because moto dudes just go for it and make it look easy. The moto dudes even tried to make the jump safer for Ellis, but he talked himself out of all of it and never did hit the jump. However, he&#8217;s determined to go back and hit that jump like a sick cunt and not eat shit. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2519951/Gerard-Butler-enjoys-rare-day-Miami-beach-just-boys.html" target="_blank">Dingo knows literally everybody</a>, including famous people, rich people, and people more powerful than Shaq. He knows so many people that 2014 is already looking like a stand-out year for TJES, because Dingo will get them in as long as they&#8217;re more powerful than Shaq. Dingo takes what he does very seriously, but nobody actually knows what the hell he does. He doesn&#8217;t snowboard anymore. He used to announce snowboarding, but not so much anymore. He pitched the Danny &amp; Dingo show, but not anymore. Dingo. He just <em>is</em>. Dingo and Jetta are one item away from dressing up exactly like each other, so expect some early morning phone calls between the two for coordination purposes. But sometimes Dingo sticks out like a fart in an elevator when he&#8217;s in Australia because he&#8217;s more American, and Tully sticks out like a turd in a punch bowl when he&#8217;s in New Jersey because he&#8217;s not an orange skinned guido.</p>
<div id="attachment_6357" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mma_news.gif" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-6357" alt="mma_news" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mma_news.gif" width="240" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mma_news.gif 320w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mma_news-300x234.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">MMA news? Wilson has you covered!</p></div>
<p>Remember how last week people suggested the show watch Call of the Wildman Turtleboy? Surprise! It sucked. It was about a busted lamp at grandma&#8217;s, a cave, and Turtleboy&#8217;s pet raccoon. So Friday Night Fights were on Friday, if you can imagine that. Dingo was too busy chatting it up with Gerard Butler and didn&#8217;t see any of it, but Kenda Perez did and she called into the show to talk about it and how massive of a head Antonio &#8220;Bigfoot&#8221; Silva has. Tully was a bit confused when the announcers said Mark Hunt looked in phenomenal shape because he looks like he&#8217;s one Baconator on a pretzel bun away from a bedridden life. Shogun looked like he wanted to murder James Te Huna, and pretty much did by knocking him out. After Kenda, Wilson came in (<em>his pants, OH!</em>) to record a new MMA News button for the show. Katie also came in (<em>not like that, it takes her longer. OH! OH! OH! Nope, not there.</em>) to help pitch ideas and say a few things for the button. What was Dingo&#8217;s contribution? Pound for pound and karate chop! Bravo, you ledge! Everyone went around the room adding their contributions to what will no doubtedly be the most sought after MMA News button in the land.</p>
<div id="attachment_6356" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/im_about_to_chivalry.gif" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-6356" alt="im_about_to_chivalry" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/im_about_to_chivalry.gif" width="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m about to chivalry all over your face!</p></div>
<p>Something like 63% of Americans agree that chivalry is alive and well. And I&#8217;d have to say that in some shape, way, or form, it is &#8211; for the most part. Supposedly 1 in 7 men will offer their seat on the bus or train to a woman. I&#8217;m guessing those are for the hot women, not the slobs. Supposedly 1 in 3 men say they never assist mothers with infant / toddlers in strollers. You know this is because nobody wants to be around a screaming brat for any longer than they to be. Supposedly 1 in 5 men say they will regularly pull out a chair for women. I assume this is strictly for practical joke purposes. 82% of women surveyed said they would prefer to pay on dates. Yeah, right. Who the fuck are you trying to kid? Supposedly 89% of women said they would not accept help carrying their own bags. You&#8217;re just asking to get mugged at that point, right? Women want to be treated as equals, so of course some of the old-fashioned chivalry would not happen in today&#8217;s world. Is there even a need to throw your cape down over a puddle for a woman to walk on? Not if you live anywhere near a society. And if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re living subsistence life style so the woman is used to getting dirty. All this is about being a gentleman. And if you&#8217;re not one, you&#8217;re probably partly responsible for Honey Boo Boo. But chicks, you could be partly responsible too if you&#8217;re just a pure piece of trash who can&#8217;t even respect herself. Paris Hilton&#8217;s brother Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s friend dad party Dingo and I just shat my poop out. And that about does it for today&#8217;s re-cap. I sure do hope you enjoyed it, because I made it myself, slaved over it for hours, making just right, thinking of all your favorite things. So&#8230; Why&#8217;d the semen cross the road? I wore the wrong pair of socks. OH!</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with the re-cap, I just thought it was impressive as fuck.<br />

<p>If there was ever a Friday to not give a fuck, this my friends is the mother load.  Not only is it Ellis Mania 9 weekend, obvi, but its also Ellismate&#8217;s birthday today.  Live at the Hard Rock hotel in the lovely Las Vegas today&#8217;s show was fucking sick.  Instead of running the credits after the movie, here are the notable names you would have seen if you weren&#8217;t at home jerking like me and many others.  Of course you have the usuals like The Wing, RawDog, Tully, Wilson, and the frequent fliers like Dingo, Cumtard, Katie.  You have Joe Mills, Kit Cope, Kenji, and Ellis Mania legend Crazy Jerr!!!  Shit man Sluggo, TJ Lavin, Butterballs and Ms. Butterballs in her I love Butterballs shirt&#8230;.the fucking list goes on.  Of them all, none dressed better than Jizz Cult who was none other than Butt Judge for this year&#8217;s show, a role he was born to molest play.  Ellis is gonna be looking sharp himself at EM9, rocking a sweet pair of Manny Pacquiao orange boxing shoes, and yes Big Daddy Jas Cakes wears orange shoes, HAHAHAA!!!  Also to add to the fight night wardrobe, a freshly shaved chest, man shit!  It&#8217;s helped Ellis achieve &#8220;winning weight&#8221; and Minnesota is the &#8220;Tijuana of Canada&#8221;.  Remember I told you about Will Butt Judge Pendarvis III like 2 sentences ago, he&#8217;s already taking some prey, all conveniently named Tara believe it or not.  His first and quite fitting, Most Stalkable Ass.  Then shit got creepy as he tagged a pregnant lady Just Like Mom Use To Make.  Then shit got more creepier as some dude got Butt Judged, Hairiest Ass!  Then shit got fucking hot, as Katie gave Will, the fans, the world a thesis worthy display of what an ass looks like!</p>

<p>Man Bags love &#8217;em, and so does about 9 billion dollars apparently.  Dingo makes man bags, well fanny packs really, but with speakers so their kinda gangster, fuck man I&#8217;m so confused right now.  Then Kit Cope and Ellis got on some tirade about how when they punch each other in the face, its more sensual and meaningful than when Ellis shoved his tongue down RawDogs throat, which I just find hard to believe but you just read it on the internet, so its probably true.  Enough of that shit though, lets get down to business and decide this year&#8217;s Little Miss Jason Ellis.  We have three contestants this year, Amanda, Deidre, and the defending Little Miss Ellis, Jason.  For the first leg of this event, each participant must answer a few questions, such as if Amanda were President and involved in RawDog&#8217;s orgy this weekend, what would she do?  Film that shit, and give the proceeds to charity!  She also thinks is not gay to DP and that Deidre has a shitty jacket.  Deidre thinks the show needs more female guests.  Jason was asked who he would murder, just in random conversation and he said Wilson of course, especially since he has a Butt Judge sticker on his ass from Will and he wasn&#8217;t sure why.  Enough of that shit though &#8211; straight to the Limbo!!!  Yeah, I can&#8217;t really type much about Limbo but from the sounds of it the crowd really were the winners here, well depending on your view.  Other than that all you need to know is TJ Lavin has a license to drop C-Bombs, there are currently like 18 dudes willing to take part in Josh&#8217;s orgy tonight, and Ellis maybe working on a 12 woman dutch rudder, all this alleged of course!</p>

<p>Kenda Perez is fucking hot!  I probably should just end it there since that&#8217;s all you need to give a fuck about if anything at all.  Well that and there isn&#8217;t much I can really tell you other than Ellis has a stripper pole in his room and really was putting game to Kendra, but not quite enough to get her to limbo, FUCK!  I guess this is as good a time as any to shout out to lets see, Kenji aka MMA Elvis, oh and of course Betsy who&#8217;s posting a very generous prize to a couple of fights for the winners choice of charity.  Did I tell you Ellis has a stripper pole in his room at the Hard Rock?  Hey ladies, its the Ladies Naked On It Challenge and for this, when the ladies get to the push ups, SHUT THE FUCK UP!  Truthfully we&#8217;ll see how good the audio from this is but I&#8217;m spanking on it not being worthy of Shannon Shenanigans Guns Guns.  Oh yeah, Ellis has a stripper pole in his fucking room no joke!</p>

<p>If your reading this, Death! Death! Die! has probably left the building, but I bet they fucking rocked it bro.  Remember the dude who rocked the Friday show at Ellis mania 8 when he puked on the crew, you know the dude in the Super Man undies, that dude was there again sans the big boy draws.  OK OK I&#8217;ll stop stalling, back to The Little Miss Jason Ellis contest and stage 3 which is none other than Celebrity Impressions.  Amanda did a slightly spot on Bill Cosby and former Little Miss Ellis did a pretty hilarious real Jason Ellis, but not the real one kinda the fake one that Rawdog does, he did that!  They both lost though to Deidre&#8217;s memorable Al Pacino though.  This basically tied it all up so we went to a sudden death that&#8217;s not a sudden death Banana Eating Contest and to quote the immortal David Lee Roth, a little more to the left!!!  Time for Ellismate to go live in the crowd for a unprecedented Dude Am I A Slut for the ladies, and Get The Cock Off Your Chest for the fellas.  Unfortunate, well maybe fortunate, yeah its fortunate that it instead turned into Who Wants To Make Out With Ellis for ladies, and Who Wants To Make Out With Katie for the ladies, and the fellas can just hang tight!  Well turns out there aren&#8217;t that many sluts in Vegas which I still call bullshit on, and there&#8217;s a ton of cocks on chests though which I can understand.  None of them of course bigger than the cock some dude got off his chest and out his mouth, oh and some other dude DP&#8217;d his chic with a mold of himself but he was just bragging more than anything.</p>

<p>Welcome back as we check in with this year&#8217;s Little Miss Jason Ellis contest and it&#8217;s time for Karaoke.  To start us off we were blessed with Deidre&#8217;s best attempt to rock Jerry Was A Race Car Driver which was aight.  Then we got a cheesy yet very sexy Happy Birthday from Amanda to Ellis, but it wasn&#8217;t no where as good as Jason, the former Little Miss Ellis, and his bone chilling Nothing Compares which was literally spot fucking on!  Somehow Deidre, I think, got another shot and went balls clit out with Angel Of Death and fucking ripped shit up, and I think it may have got her this year&#8217;s title, but I never really got clarification on that so tune in next time to find out who will be this year&#8217;s Little Miss Jason Ellis!!!  Oh, and just for good measure we got to watch/hear Cumtard dance while testing out the shock collars for tomorrows fights as Kit Cope gazed at his crotch in amazement.  So from all of us here at NoYouAre, and while wishing Jason Ellis a Happy Mother Fucking Birthday, you know the one where you get a cake, but not just any cake nah this one has some filthy old bukkake covered shemale who will just call your mom jump right out the middle of it and just yells at the top her her lungs, Red Fucking Dragons and kick Gabe&#8217;s ass, enjoy the show like its your last&#8230;.cause ya never know!</p>
