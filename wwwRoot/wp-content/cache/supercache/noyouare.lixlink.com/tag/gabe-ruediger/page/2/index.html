<p>It&#8217;s Monday. And this is a recap. Are you ready for a loud Dingo? I hope so, because he&#8217;s in the studio. Ellis might hire Dingo to say &#8220;Jason Ellis&#8221; in his big boy voice, but he might have to work on it because he doesn&#8217;t really have that deep of a voice. Dingo&#8217;s elevator talks to him and his cereal berates him. Ellis used to pray to get his wife back, but that didn&#8217;t happen so either there is no god or maybe there is a god and god was all like, &#8220;dude, you don&#8217;t want that&#8221; and therefore didn&#8217;t give his wife back. Dingo would go to church with Ellis if he wanted. But I&#8217;m pretty sure the congregation would forcibly remove Dingo because he just can&#8217;t go more than 60 seconds without being loud. That&#8217;s our Dingo! Jon Jones almost lost his fight with Alexander Gustafsson, but the Lord is a big Jones fan so you know what&#8217;s up. No matter if he like either one of those dude or not, their fight was pretty amazing, you could even say it was almost, god-like. Speaking of god/s, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/enhu8ji_pA/" target="_blank">Ellis and Katie went to see Metallica</a> and they were so close to James Hetfield that Ellis almost cried like 3 times. Apparently, Scott Greenstein knows Metallica and was a big part of some things Ellis was into when he was younger, which blew Ellis&#8217; mind a bit. Ellis saw a bunch of other people there as well. He talked Opie, you know &#8211; that dude from Opie &amp; Anthony. They talked about their past shit talking back and forth sessions and shit and talk, in the end Opie &amp; Ellis are cool with each other. Howard Stern gangled up in the Metallica concert as well. That&#8217;s all we really were supposed to know, but we overheard Ellis talking to Wilson on <em>&#8220;accident&#8221;</em>. Everyone started cheering for Stern and all Ellis could think of was how he&#8217;s gonna take that shit. He&#8217;s super jealous but he also thinks it&#8217;s straight up gross that he&#8217;s so jealous of wanting to be as big and import as Stern. And that&#8217;s how Tully got hepatitis.</p>

<p>Tiger discovered his balls this weekend. He asked his mommy what they were, then he started squeezing them until one of his balls did what balls sensing danger do, it went and hid. Then he pushed them together and showed his mommy that when he does this, it looks like a butt. And so starts an entire lifetime of playing with one&#8217;s balls. Have fun kid, you&#8217;re going to be doing this for the rest of your life. Gabe Ruediger is apparently feeling neglected this time around since Ellis fans aren&#8217;t razing him as much. So some of us hardcore fans started tough talking Gabe using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DummyTrashTalking&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#DummyTrashTalking</a>. News time! A Texas jury gave a <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/09/19/texas-woman-gets-life-sentence-for-6th-dui-conviction/" target="_blank">44 year-old woman a life sentence for a DUI conviction because it was her 6th DUI</a>. Take that Bartles &amp; Jaymes! Hey, are you like Rawdog and just toss your old phone in the trash? Why the fuck do you do that? You could keep it, sell it, trade it, give it away, but no. You wanna fill up a landfill, don&#8217;t ya? The new iPhone 5 has a level on it, because do you know how many burly construction dudes have the latest phone for women and dudes that love to accessorize? Ellis got sent a CD of some unsigned band and the guys reminded everyone to send in their unsigned bands, so do that. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/enQdZAiSyR/" target="_blank">Katie put a post up on Instagram</a>, so eat a dick everybody! I don&#8217;t know why I said that. I didn&#8217;t mean any harsh feelings. I love you. Anyways, this brought up Bieber talk and I&#8217;m not having any of it, so BLA-DOW! A caller phoned in to tell Ellis that Tom Leykis was talking about Ellis on his show, and then everybody was like &#8211; PSSSHHHHH! You ever have a family pet try to get all up in your sexy times? Yeah, those fuckers are creepy gross. And don&#8217;t do what Dingo does, which is fondle his dog&#8217;s balls.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/coke-retard-appeared-bottle-cap-article-1.1462368" target="_blank">Some chick in Canada with retarded kids bought a vitamin water and under the cap, it said &#8220;You retard&#8221;</a> which of course sent her into a retarded rage and Coca-Cola had to apologize for predicting who was going to get that bottle of sweet justice. Speaking of retard, Ellis wants a big ass Nerf basketball on Rawdog&#8217;s microphone because he eats his microphone and it&#8217;s too loud. This brought us to Wilson who brought in a picture of his ex-wife&#8217;s dashboard that said &#8220;refill now butthole&#8221; which totally reminded him of how his ex-wife talked to him. One of the new interns, Lynette, was the focus of a <em>&#8220;game&#8221;</em> Wilson spent many a night thinking <em>very</em> in depth about. The game? How much does everyone know about her, Wilson giving the guys 3 options to choose from for each answer. Come to find out, she has 2 half-black sisters who are both Olympiads, in different sports. She also went skinny dipping in Loch Ness with some Scotsman, she&#8217;s been to 14 Coachella&#8217;s, she ran into a parked car while she was high on that sticky-icky, went to Paris Hilton&#8217;s something or another, she was an overweight kid, got hit by a car while jaywalking, and she got fired after 1 week of working as a hostess for having an attitude.</p>

<p>You ever wondered what it was like to fly like an eagle, doot-doot-doo-doo? Ever wanted to be an eagle? Too fucking bad, you&#8217;re human. However, <a href="http://youtu.be/G3QrhdfLCO8" target="_blank">you can see what it&#8217;s like by watching this video of a GoPro strapped to an eagle in flight!</a> Dingo&#8217;s dad used to live in Kualdalaupe, which of course is in some imaginary country that is made up of a bunch of other countries that takes up pretty much all of Southern Asia. Get the cock off your chest was next up and it seems a lot of dudes have been pissing the bed lately, like an excessive amount of dudes and an excessive amount of piss. Let&#8217;s see how many of you are still actually reading this recap. 2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon sugar, ¾ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, 4 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 cup cold buttermilk, ½ cup melted unsalted butter and cooled for 5 minutes. For the topping, 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley. And there you have some basic ingredients for Red Lobster&#8217;s cheddar bay biscuits. If you&#8217;re still reading, you&#8217;re welcome. And with that, like an alcoholic or a necrophiliac, it&#8217;s time for me to go crack open a cold one. OH!</p>

			<p>You know how you can just look at the lady walking accross the street on her cell, and the chevy caviler doing a buck n change, also on the cell phone, and envision them meeting one another on a new episode of Most Shocking?  Yeah well thats called seeing the future, and who else is better at this than The Future himself.  Tully recogns its a dad thing and being SuperDad himself, and who am I to argue.  Who can argue with some of the stories we fans send into the show, you know the one&#8217;s with a dude, well a dude&#8217;s head, attached to a bag, and how you &#8220;Gotta check this shit out&#8221;.  Tully apparently gets a few hundred of those a day, which only means Ellis must get millions and RawDog, well lets just say he was giggling the whole time and is known to be a bit tweaked.  Maybe he&#8217;s sending them all from various fake twitter handles, but I digress.  Instead may I offer you a heart warmer story of <a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/08/make-a-wish_teenager_gathering_lap_dance.php">how magnets do work</a>, well that they do their job, cause no one knows how the fuck those things work.  No one in Nascar seems to know how to make a fucking right, right!  Yeah so the boys threw around some Nascar/Kimbo Slice stories all of which are available On Demand with the SiriusXM app.  You could also catch the replay tomorrow via the online player, but not if your RawDog&#8230;..Today may be the saddest day in Ellis Show history, well except for the day Josh n Jason made out, as RawDog&#8217;s computer has passed away to ghetto gigabyte heaven.  From there I kinda teared up and wasn&#8217;t myself ofr a mintue, I mean I feel for the guy, so I all really got after that was that everyone must surf to save energy to avoid nuking babies, yeah thats about right!</p>

<p>What <del>rock</del> jungle did you crawl out of? Well considering amazon.com is located in Brazil, <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-08/rare-video-footage-shows-completely-isolated-amazonian-tribe">Im not fucking with these dudes</a>.  I&#8217;m also not fucking with Joe Rogan, because he&#8217;d tweet my phone number and shit to get back at me.  He would be an awesome announcer for EllisMania, but since he ain&#8217;t been asked its not looking good.  Rabid wolves looked good, on a t-shirt and front and center at the LA Zoo, but for a limited time only I&#8217;m guessing.  Apparently Tully says they like to eat dogs when all hoped up on the rabies, and they enjoy humans too (Didn&#8217;t catch if thats to hang out or to eat, but Im willing to roll those dice).  They also eat you while your alive, which is really thoughtful since you&#8217;d just want it over with as slow and painful as possible.  Rabid wolves can also been seen at the Hard Rock in Vegas this <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/ellis-mania-9-las-vegas-nevada-10-12-2013/event/2C004AF1AC253CB7">Saturday, October 12th</a> and again, they are not harmful&#8230;..as long as you don&#8217;t spill their beer!  Seriously folks I kinda missed a bit of the show but like Ellis do ponder if the bear proof steal suit guy could befriend rabid wolves cause he&#8217;s all inedible n what not.  From there it was just gifts from Will not Pendarvis for all the boys to enojy such as Tim Tams and Caramel Koalas.  Not EllisMate though, he&#8217;s gotta train to have all his mental energy to rig this upcomnig fight, so Tully n RawDog I say Good On Ya!</p>

<p>If your a dude born as a chic and you know it clap your dick!!  And while your at it move your ass out to Cali baby where you can choose which bathroom you wanna use in elementary school.  Kinda gonna put an end to Pimping Aint Easy, and shitty women&#8217;s basketball one could hope!  Shout out to EllisFam Zach Howard who won the Ellis T-Shirt contest and will be receiving a new Wolfknives ring and a collab with The Wing to get this puppy up for sale!  No shout out to those who sent in bomb drops cause TJES still needs a good clean bomb drop if you got one laying around.  I guess Will Jizz Cult Pendarvis III has wolfknive names laying around cause some of the shit he had today was just miraculous.  Such ledges as The Shocker, Holy Diver, The Tank, and who could forget Mr. Freezer.  He did pull Kansas City Guacamole out of his ass, but thats just what he&#8217;s into since he&#8217;s got him that sketchy swordfish nutjob for his nut jobs, allegedly of course.  So some baby in India blew up for like the 4th time, just minutes before they put my ass on hold to pay my cable bill.  Its some phenomenon that people can just combust spontaneously, kinda like premature ejaculation for but a burning sensation before and during as opposed to after.  That almost happened to Lance Mountain one time, not the early wad thing but the combustion deal.  He lit a rag on fire after gassing up his board on his final run, but was too fast for that shit to catch so I&#8217;m guessing lost to &#8220;Hey Hey, It&#8217;s Tony Hawk&#8221; but who hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rabid+Wolf.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5594" alt="Rabid+Wolf" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rabid+Wolf.jpg" width="500" height="500" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rabid+Wolf.jpg 500w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rabid+Wolf-150x150.jpg 150w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rabid+Wolf-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Teen Advice anyone?  I mean how can you tell if your gay?  What if your pee is a dark brown, could something be wrong?  How do you tell your girl to spot slapping and pinching you cause its hurting you?  Who would buy a pack of socks to jerk off in? Oh, RawDog is the answer to that last one.  Turns out The Illusionist makes his junk disappear into a pair of Hanes finest, but by himself as opposed to with two other dudes!  Not anymore though as we all know he&#8217;s tagging more ass than something that tags a lot of asses, and why not.  We all know the dudes who were cool in school grew up to be a tool, and those who fucked off turned out to be millionaires.  Don&#8217;t believe me, then call 855-ELLIS41 at 7am on the east side, 4am on the west, and yell &#8220;FORE&#8221;.  Not sure what the hell that is suppose to mean, but final calls can be shaky at times.  Speaking of shaky, I was at Shakey&#8217;s one time when I noticed these two fine chics one the other side of the salad bar.  So I shoved a cucumber in my pants to make them think I had a dick like a snake, you know for ultimate satisfaction, and proceeded past the diced carrots to get a closer look.  I get around to the other side and ask this massive whale of a beast if she saw two ladies just here a second ago, and as she turns around I see a huge streak of shit stain drool down the front of her blouse only to realize my mistake&#8230;&#8230;I didn&#8217;t look at her face, OH!</p>

<p>Today is a day. So welcome to it! On this day in history, NASA was created and Wil Wheaton was born. In more important news, we&#8217;ve got bush! And we&#8217;ve got a live show today. Apparently Ellis got a lot of shit on Instagram while he was off for 3 whole days with strep throat. I&#8217;ll pass along on the message to anyone who gave him shit, &#8220;Fuck you, I&#8217;m out. You couldn&#8217;t last 10 seconds. I&#8217;m out.&#8221; So there ya go, haters. Now you&#8217;re gonna have to go find someone else with strep throat to hate on. Dingo is close to overdosing on homemade meatballs. He&#8217;s feeling pretty shitty because he&#8217;s been eating more of those meatballs than your mom has eaten men&#8217;s balls. Jeff Goldblum greeted Tully&#8217;s baby, and he also saw Andy Richter recently. So meet the newest socialite on the scene, Michael Tully! Rawdog is going to start up a Jason Ellis garden where he gives daily updates on watering, growth, potting soils, etc. to keep everyone thoroughly entertained. <del>Gay Bar Wars</del> no <del>Gay Bar Stores</del> no Bar Rescue, there we go, Bar Rescue was on TV and it&#8217;s a show. And it&#8217;s on TV. Ellis is recommending it, even though he makes fun of the dude&#8217;s face. Me, on the other hand? Do yourself a favor stay away from it, it&#8217;ll give you ball cancer. DJ Go For It (aka DJ Blue Steel) says the whole Bar Rescue show is fake as fuck. Surprise!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://io9.com/lab-grown-burger-will-be-the-most-expensive-ever-served-940038258" target="_blank">most expensive burger in the world</a> was served this week, it&#8217;s grown from cultured stem cells of a single cow and cost about $385,000. Lab grown burger, mmmm. Also in burger news, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Bo0gy" target="_blank">some dude ordered 1,000 extra slices of cheese for his Whopper</a>. The <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/mass-girl-9-becomes-youngest-u-s-chess-master-1.1387367" target="_blank">world&#8217;s youngest chess grandmaster was crowned</a>, bitch be 9-years-old and Asian. Moto news time. Over the weekend, James Stewart won Spring Creek Nationals for the first time this season. Trey Canard was second overall and Ryan Dungey was third overall. In the 250&#8217;s, Eli Tomac won his fourth victory of the season and took the lead in the season standings. In UFC news, Demetrious &#8220;Mighty Mouse&#8221; Johnson won his fight against John Moraga. Rory MacDonald beat Jake Ellenberger in a total lackluster fight. Robbie Lawler kicked Bobby Voelker in de head and won that shit. In UTI news, Michael &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t tickle when I piss on my balls&#8221; Tully has himself a urinary tract infection, diagnosed by Dr. Michael Tully, Ph. D. Probably not all that surprising, Rawdog and Cumtard have both had urinary tract infections as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_5448" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bruce_willis.gif" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-5448" alt="bruce_willis" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bruce_willis.gif" width="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bruce Willis is a fan of NYA!</p></div>
<p>A man from Maine was sentenced to a week in jail after he <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-jailed-pooping-pants-article-1.1411572" target="_blank">left shit smeared on the floor and up the wall of a federal courthouse&#8217;s bathroom</a>. He blamed his medication for shitting his pants and creating the mess. The real question is, why do they want that man to shit in more of their facilities? According to Dingo, this kind of thing happens all the time with snowboarders when they take a hard slam, they blast human mud out of their ass &#8211; so watch out for that during the upcoming X-Games! Segway into talk about EllisMania 9, fights, and who will be in it. Ellis is obviously fighting Gay Bruediger again. The musical chair fight and shock collar fights are a must. Then it was time to let the fans try and come up with some fight ideas. I missed a lot of this part thanks to work, the online player cutting out on me. the mobile player not working correctly, and a myriad of other shit. Oh well. I&#8217;m not going to keep going back only for the fucking player to crash out on me on the same god damned spot every time. Which brings me to this. A plane is falling out of the sky. A female passenger jumps up out of her seat, tears her clothes off and exclaims, &#8220;Is there anyone man enough on this plane to make me feel like a real woman before I die?&#8221; A man across the aisle stands up, hurriedly unbuttoning his shirt. He gets it off and throws it at the woman. &#8220;Iron this.&#8221; OH!</p>

<p>Holy shit. Did you see Monday&#8217;s re-cap of Friday&#8217;s show? It&#8217;s like he&#8217;s not even trying anymore. Let&#8217;s see if I can do a better job with today&#8217;s re-cap! Aaaaand done. There ya go! All I had to do was get the name of the post and date right. HAHAA! Okay, all kidding and razzing aside, lets see what we have in store for us today, or actually. Let&#8217;s start with what we don&#8217;t have in store for today, Dingo. We got no Dingo today, he&#8217;s in Jamaica or some shit. And then we got spoken to about tits, deep, deep underwater, aliens inside of us, and gaping. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=social+d&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.aWM&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=781&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=GEXkUfH6LqHYywHBjoCICQ#um=1&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=angler+fish&amp;oq=angler+fish&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.701425.703087.0.703470.11.8.0.3.3.0.147.700.6j2.8.0....0...1c.1.19.img.OH-0dHQQc1U&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.aWc&amp;fp=4ce5695442c5bd0b&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=781" target="_blank">Angler fish are fucked up looking</a> and they&#8217;ll explode if they&#8217;re not in the deep, deep underwater depths of the ocean. Are there any monster&#8217;s that have fucked to spawn another monster? It appears that yes, indeed, there was a baby Godzilla. Ellis isn&#8217;t a dog beater, he&#8217;s salty with Burger Ellis, but not all abusey and shit. Bas Rutten is like the Bruce Wayne of southern California. Ellis thinks his ex-wife might be going to clubs full of only rich guys. This brought up rich dudes that pay for a matchmaking service to hook them up with potential wives. Why do these rich guys need a matchmaker? Probably because they&#8217;re uber assholes that don&#8217;t really care about the other person, they just want a hot trophy to fuck and someone who they can string along by enticing by dangling the all mighty carrot (money) in front of their faces. Ellis thinks Gabe Ruediger will end up backing out of his fight with Ellis, and Ellis says he might just go into a career of boxing once he demolishes him. Oh, and Rawdog recorded a rap single with his little brother, MC Young Yiddishy, over the weekend.</p>
<div id="attachment_5288" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/soul_sister.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5288" alt="soul_sister" src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/soul_sister.png" width="240" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/soul_sister.png 321w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/soul_sister-222x300.png 222w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look, that&#8217;s just badass.</p></div>
<p>So, that Asiana Airlines crash that happened? They&#8217;re going to <a href="http://youtu.be/kfhfxNIMJjA" target="_blank">sue KTVU-TV over broadcast of racist fake pilot names</a>, those being: Captain Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, and Bang Ding Ow. Talking about the reporters who were fooled into reading those names, up came the <a href="http://youtu.be/aMS0O3kknvk" target="_blank">reporter lady that fell while stomping grapes</a> and made funny noises while having the wind knocked out of her. Then there was Trayvon Martin talk, and holy shit I ain&#8217;t even gonna get into this shit storm of a discussion. I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of outlets for you to read and discuss it if you like. Anyway, that discussion took up the better part of an hour, so let&#8217;s see what was next. Over 70 percent of American&#8217;s keep their smartphones within 5 feet from them and 12% have used their smartphones while making whoopie. Rawdog&#8217;s doggy-style partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/mzkarlaxoxo" target="_blank">Karla Lane</a>, was on the show today and Rawdog does not want Ellis to put his balls on her. We found out that it&#8217;s specifically Ellis that Rawdog has an issue with when it comes to Karla. He&#8217;s okay with her career and multiple cocks, but anything to do with Ellis, he get&#8217;s super territorial. It seems to be the foreskin, because both Rawdog and Karla have an aversion to it. Rawdog has been doing more doggy style and he also had his first shower sex recently, so shout out to his cockery skills.</p>
<p>That last exchange between Ellis, Rawdog, and Karla re-hashed some feelings from a few weeks ago, what has come to be known as the infamous Chick-Fil-A incident of 2013. Tully thought Ellis was making a bigger deal out of it than Rawdog was, things got a little heated but simmered down fairly quickly and the show moved on. In case you didn&#8217;t know, Ellis has an Instagram (<a href="http://instagram.com/wolfmate" target="_blank">@wolfmate</a>) and he got 4,700+ likes on <a href="http://instagram.com/p/bwmFbYC_rU/" target="_blank">a video of his lizard skateboarding</a> and doesn&#8217;t know how he got that many views. And that pretty much wrapped up the show, minus of course all the final callers that <em>still</em> don&#8217;t understand that you&#8217;re supposed to talk the show out, not ask questions. Speaking of fuctarded people. What&#8217;s the difference between Sarah Palin&#8217;s mouth and her vagina?<br />
Only one fifth of the things that come out of her vagina are retarded. OH!</p>

			<p>Lets talk about our emotions, and how they effect us each and every Thursday. If your getting high to hide your emotions, well that&#8217;s not good.  If your using music to feel your emotions well that&#8217;s fucking sweet.  Therefore if your high and listening to music, you&#8217;ve figured out the meaning of life.  And welcome to today&#8217;s show and straight into how Jersey Shore is expanding like Wu-Tang, everyone&#8217;s getting their own show on MTV, but not Ellis, FUCK!  No one wants to pick up ol&#8217; MC Hollywood for a season or two?  Not Rawdog, who claims to be from Hollywood but really is better know as Mr. Marina Del Ray, but Ellismate, who is not from Hollywood so could claim to be MC Hollywood, is better know as MC Sanderingham.  Mr. New Jersey, who claims to be Mr. New York, and better know as Mr. Oxford as far as I&#8217;m concerned, had to roll the fuck out for a few to get Ellis some Codeine for his Aids he&#8217;s getting.  Without Tully in studio, talk went to washer&#8217;s and dryers, and of course Rawdog&#8217;s dick.  Oh, let me explain that&#8230;..you see Ellis just moved in so he needs a new washer and dryer, and Rawdog could use one but doesn&#8217;t have the cash for it allegedly.  Oh, and Rawdog is going to his gay roommates party and is figruing out his best lines for getting some stank on his hang down.  So far, Rawdog&#8217;s best bet is to quote the average dick size of 5 1/4&#8243;, and immediately notify them he&#8217;s packing a clean 7&#8243; of Taint Stick.</p>

<p>Apparently all people in South Korea look the same, even in beauty pageants, or so I learned on TJES!  I also learneded that <a href="https://twitter.com/stujasperMMA">Mike Jasper</a> is pretty fucking gnarly too.  If you don&#8217;t recall Mike is the dude Ellis was sparring a few weeks ago on EllisMania.com, the cool one who didn&#8217;t beat the shit out of him too bad, much respect.  Dude is a perfect 6-0 in professional fights, but said he did have a fight in Vegas that didn&#8217;t technically count in which he did get knocked out, and that&#8217;s one he remembers.  Dude&#8217;s a warrior, and practices the Dolce Diet too so get it up ya if ya haven&#8217;t yet!  I missed about 10 minutes of the interview, only to come back to <a href="https://twitter.com/NorCalRowe">Joe Rowe</a> using some training mask in preparation for this year&#8217;s Bong Olympics, Red Dragons to you my friend!  Back to Jasper the Angry Ghost, and shout out to him for bringing tickets to give to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ellisfam&amp;src=typd">#EllisFam</a> for his <a href="http://www.nfamma.com/">upcoming fight May 11th</a> in Woodlands Hills, CA.  He&#8217;ll be beating the shit out of Lee Chapman who is 4-8 for another couple of weeks.  So wonder what this mutha fucker here can do on the punch machine?  Well not sure what happened really, maybe he was psyched out from Branden Schaub&#8217;s score was less than Ellis&#8217;s, or maybe he just missed that stupid fucking star in the middle, but he topped out at a 56.  Hey dude, at least you beat Rawdog!  In MMA News, Anderson Silva could beat Rawdog too, even after <a href="http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2013/04/anderson-silvas-new-contract-a-done-deal-according-to-ufc-president">his new contract</a> extending him for 12 more fights in all.  Crazy Bones Jones said he&#8217;s got some record to set first before fighting in another weight class, in case you were wondering.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagcqNBy3hA">Kimbo Slice still exists</a>, knocking MoFo&#8217;s out in Australia!  Finally, and most improtantly of all, it was rumored that Ellis&#8217; next fight at Ellismania may be a rematch with Gay Bruediger, but kickboxing this time!</p>

<div id="attachment_4818" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kimbo-Slice-Pic-1024x646.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4818" alt="Sorry Kimbo, I wasn't saying you didn't exist..." src="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kimbo-Slice-Pic-1024x646-300x189.gif" width="300" height="189" srcset="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kimbo-Slice-Pic-1024x646-300x189.gif 300w, http://noyouare.lixlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kimbo-Slice-Pic-1024x646-475x300.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sorry Kimbo, I wasn&#8217;t saying you didn&#8217;t exist&#8230;</p></div>

<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again folks, time to vote for your favorite to be the <a href="http://www.twistys.com/landing/toty?nats=MTk3NTcyOjExOjE,0,0,0,0">2013 Twisty&#8217;s Treat Of The Year</a>.  Say hello to Spencer Scott and Karlie Montana, two of the contestants for this contest I speak of.  Apparently the winner gets some money, a diamond necklace, and one grand for a charity of their choice.  Wonder what that charity would be?  &#8220;Um, I don&#8217;t have a clue, maybe Um animals?&#8221;  Let me ask you this EllisFam, do all the dumb bitches come on the show on Thursday&#8217;s?  Here&#8217;s what you didn&#8217;t miss, a four part contest to see who you should vote for.  In round 1, Spencer is proud of her blow job accomplishments, is best at everything in bed, and fucks like Bill Clinton.  Karlie spits load of 34 story buildings in Canada, wishes she had no tonsils to get the dick in further, an thinks squirting is the greatest thing achieved of the last century &#8211; guess who won!  Round 2 was phone sex with callers, using voice altermacation of course, but only Karlie was down to phone fuck, Spencer pussed out.  Round 3 was the punch machine, Spencer 36, Karlie 39.  Round 4 was for Ellis to sniff a line of their pussy and judge.  Karlie&#8217;s was like America and Monster Energy in one.  Spencer&#8217;s, besides not even being in the competition, apparently smelled all fruity and shit, so again guess who won.  4 &#8211; 0 sweep, bottom line folks, don&#8217;t waste your time on this shit and just enjoy your weekend!</p>

<p>Hollywood News anyone?  Cops in Stockholm, Sweden say <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/25/justin-bieber-marijuana-bust-sweden-tour-bush/">Justin Bieber</a> was rolling with weed and a stun gun, but arrested him only because he was hanging with that Lil Za fucker again, damn Biebs!  Bieber was also late to some photo shoot and another concert, but fuck off ok!  <a href="http://www.sohh.com/2013/04/graphic_ex-nappy_roots_members_post-poli.html">Some dude</a> from the Nappy Roots got beat down by Po Po Mo Fo!  Remember that whole &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know who I am&#8221; from Reese Witherspoon the other day, turns out someone looked up other times that shit happened and <a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/fashion/celebrities-pulled-infamous-dont-know-am-line-153200750.html">Bob&#8217;s Your Uncle</a>.  In other Hollywood News, Ellis say&#8217;s don&#8217;t watch The Crow cause it fucking sucks now, and some dude did a ton of blow in it and got all sleepy n shit, and that doesn&#8217;t really happen.  I kinda sorta missed a little more of the show, only to come back to Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek and Ellismate all in a cab, shooting it out with Jay Z, all inside of some chics carnival&#8230;..but I never did find out her name!  Bruno Mars says fuck Joe&#8217;s Crab Shack.  And finally <del>La Toya Jackson says Michael Jackson&#8217;s ghost tap dancers in her house</del>, never mind!  Teen Advice, need some, get some &#8211; well ok maybe not really, but if you&#8217;ve ever questioned whether Ellis, Rawdog or Tully would fuck a clone of them self, No Way for Tully, Why Not for RawDizzle, and Yes For A MTV Show for Young Wing.  For the rest of them, I think Tully put it best when he suggested &#8216;move to the sewer and become lord of the underground&#8217;.  Except for that one 17year old lesbo who&#8217;s gonna eventually fuck her teacher, good luck!  And as far as any suggestions for your grandmama, how about five and a quarter inches is all I&#8217;ll put in if you don&#8217;t shut the fuck up, OH!</p>
