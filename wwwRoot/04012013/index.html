						<h2>How I lost my virginity:</h2>
                        <p>I was a blooming 15-year-old with hard features and soft hands just trying to earn a buck mowing lawns while school was out. I was making good money after a week and was even starting to get referrals from my clients to new customers.</p>
						<p>One day while I was taking a break and getting a drink from a client's garden hose, I looked across the street and noticed a small white van parked in front of one of my other customer's house. Beyond the van, I could see a stout, brown man with shoulder length hair and a tight green shirt stretched across his rippling back muscles. Though I was far away I could make out the owner subtly shaking his head followed by him closing the door. When the boy turned around I felt the already hot sun start to burn even hotter and a bead of sweat trickled down into my asscrack. He was the single most breathtaking thing I had ever seen in my entire life. His obsidian, chin-lengthed hair fanned through the air as he turned back towards the van, and his perfectly formed pencil mustache framed his pouty lips as he walked to the driver side window. While he was behind the van I noticed the hose was still spraying water and it had been running down into my boots, soaking my socks. I dropped the hose and shook my  feet around hopelessly. I hadn't packed another pair of socks in my truck, so I bent down to untie them. As I got the first set of laces untied, a shadow fell over me. I raised my head to find a Mexican flag plastered across a Mexican boy. I stood up and managed to stammer a &quot;hello.&quot; He explained to me that I had been stealing his business and that these were his clients. His Latin fire was burning white hot through my heart while he explained all of this to me. Without a word, I picked up the still-running garden hose and began to cascade it down my sun-toasted chest and abdomen while rubbing my nipples. This threw him off, I could tell, because he took a step backwards and became speechless. I told him there was only one way he was getting his customers back.</p>
						<p>I came to believe in magic that night in his Uncle's work van. There were shovels and clippers being tossed all across the floor boards with passion and purpose. Crumpled up McDonald's wrappers were the only padding we had, but then again, we didn't need padding. It was all about the moment. The only sounds beyond our muffled breaths was the creaking suspension on his 20-year old van and the soft <em>ploosh, ploosh, ploosh</em> sound of the water in my socks squishing inside my boots. There was passion, there was aggression, and there was release.</p>
						<p>The next day, I called INS and the boy was deported back to Mexico. It hurt me to put business in front of passion, but Juan shouldn't have fish-hooked me.</p>

						<h3>What the fuck is this?</h3>
						<p>It's an April Fool's joke! And a joke we here at NYA decided to play on our good friend and fellow writer, <a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/">@AZ_RedDragon</a>.</p>
						<p>You see, he went on vacation to Mexico. So of course we immediately thought about how we could fuck with him. Why not make a fake dating profile for him? Sounded like a great idea!</p>
						<p>Before we could blink, it turned into something quite a bit bigger and we decided it was big enough to tease everyone with, so that's what we did. Happy April Fool's and welcome back <a href="http://noyouare.lixlink.com/">@AZ_RedDragon</a>!</p>
